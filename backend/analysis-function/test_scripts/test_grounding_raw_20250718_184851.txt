The social worker's approach is problematic because it fails to meet several key Arkansas child welfare training standards. The immediate demand for entry lacks rapport and transparency. The parent's defensive response is entirely predictable, and I will explore specific communication techniques to remedy this in subsequent interactions.\n\n\n",
