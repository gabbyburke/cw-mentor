  **Reviewing Interview Protocols**
  
  I'm currently reviewing the interview transcript and starting to identify key elements from the provided text. I'm aligning those elements with the Arkansas child welfare training materials. I'm actively looking at best practices to inform the categories and content of the JSON output. I plan to map the data appropriately to the required format, starting with a general overview.

  **Mapping Initial Behaviors**
  
  I've started mapping the initial interactions. The social worker's opening lacks crucial elements like a full introduction, the reason for the visit, and a permission request, as per best practices in engagement, as outlined in the Arkansas child welfare training. I'm now identifying the parent's reactions and noting how the social worker's approach is perceived, specifically the accusatory tone and revealing of sensitive information.

  **Evaluating First Impressions**
  
  I've identified the first few interactions and have begun categorizing them based on assessment criteria. The social worker's introduction and the parent's response are crucial areas for improvement, showing a lack of adherence to best practices in introductory engagement. I'm now assessing the parent's defense mechanisms, which seem highly triggered by the social worker's approach, specifically the accusation of violence and drug use without establishing trust.

  I'm now focused on extracting data directly from the provided interview transcript. Specifically, I'm identifying examples of best practices and their absence. For example, I've noted the failure to fully introduce the social worker and the lack of a clear purpose for the visit, which violates crucial engagement techniques. My current focus is on ensuring the JSON output accurately captures both the strengths and weaknesses identified during the review.

    The PCA then determines whether the parents and the Department can agree on what change is needed. Domestic violence may not have been initially identified as a present danger safety threat or impending danger safety threat in the assessment process when other abuse and neglect issues were present. Building rapport with the adult victim during the PCA can facilitate the sharing of information about domestic violence. This discovery can lead to a change in the ongoing safety plan and in the conditions for return. The following material relates to families for which domestic violence has specifically been identified as an impending danger safety threat; in other words, one or both parents' or caregivers' behavior is violent and/or they are acting (behaving) dangerously. Other impending danger safety threats and diminished protective capacities may also exist in families where domestic violence is present.CHILD WELFARE PRACTICES FOR CASES WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE58 # Back to TOC There are four stages in the initial PCA: preparation, introduction, exploration, and change strategy and case planning. The first stage is undertaken by the caseworker to thoughtfully prepare to engage the parents in the process. The second stage is intended to introduce the concepts of the PCA to the parents and to request their willingness to engage in the process.

Participants may receive services more than once a year based upon current safety issues. Payments are generally made directly to landlords or to specific providers. When a client accesses Child Welfare and TANF services, DHS Child Welfare and Self- Sufficiency staff are encouraged to work together on service and case plans. This reduces the likelihood that the client is given conflicting expectations. ## Family Support and Connections program Family Support and Connections is available for TANF and Child Welfare clients. Staff provide families with advocacy for services in the community, supports to strengthen parenting, coping skills and other necessary skills to support the healthy development of their children.

    # Self-Paced Learning ## #4: Introduction and Building Rapport with Children Just like your introduction or greeting with a parent, there are some steps to include when building a trusting relationship with a child. Time spent in this area can create a valuable return on investment later on in the interview when gathering abuse specific information. Introducing and explaining the process: We need to let children know who we are right away. We share our name and affiliation. An example might be; "Hi, my name is I work for a place called child welfare. My job is to help children and families. I work with all kinds of kids and families and talk to them at home or at school. I ask a lot of questions and talk to lots of people. But before I start, do you have any questions for me?" Asking Permission: Children should know that they have a choice to talk with us or not talk with us. Of course, we want them to talk with us so that we can ensure their safety, but we do not want them to feel that they are being held against their will. Checking in with the child: “What were you just doing?" It's important to know if we are interrupting something important in the child/teens day. 
    ...
    Note that the Cooper case is a domestic violence case and there are special considerations in making initial contact including: *Explore how to do the assessment when the alleged batterer is not home. If possible, call first to determine who is at home and how safe it is go to the home. *Consider meeting at a DHS Self-Sufficiency office, school or other neutral setting. *Immediately ask the alleged adult victim if it is safe to conduct an interview and, if not, ask what might be a safe way. *Never ask the alleged adult victim about domestic violence in front of the alleged batterer. Disclosures may make the alleged adult victim unsafe if the alleged batterer is in the vicinity. These suggestions are taken from the Child Welfare Practices for Cases with Domestic Violence. Case practice in cases involving domestic violence will be discussed more in Week 2 of training. How would you share information about the report of concern with Sara Cooper, after confirming that the alleged perpetrator of domestic violence is not present? 
    ...
    If interviewing a child at school and they were just getting ready to go to lunch, they may not want to talk with us. Instructions: letting the child know what is expected, so there are no surprises. Setting rules for the interview should also help put the child at ease. (reference the tips and rules half sheet included here and found in the back pocket of your binder) Notes: An important part of the introduction is to also let children know that we will be taking notes. One way to do this is to say, “While we are talking, I am going to be taking notes, because what you have to say is very important, and I don't want to forget." Rapport Building/ Narrative Practice: The last step of building rapport is to engage the child talking about something that interests them or is important to them. There are various ways to do this. One method is called a practice narrative. This rapport-building strategy utilizes an opportunity to get to know the child, show interest, and gauge the child's ability to recall an event.

    # ODHS Child Welfare Vision for Transformation¹ We believe children and young adults do best when they grow up in a family. We value fairness, equity, inclusion, accessibility, diversity, and transparency in our work. We value the voices, experiences, cultures, intellect and uniqueness of the children and families we serve. We believe that communities often already have the wisdom and assets to provide safe, stable and healthy lives for their children. Thus, Child Welfare needs to partner, listen and lift up community voices and their decision-making powers. This builds on existing resources, creates pathways to new resources and promotes community interdependence rather than a system of dependence. We value building authentic relationships and being accountable to communities of color and other marginalized communities by elevating their voices and proactively engaging with individuals, families and communities. This builds their power so Child Welfare and its partners can better ensure people's safety, health and well-being. We believe providing earlier, less-intrusive support for parents and families means more children can remain safe and healthy at home and in school. This helps children and young adults have better long-term outcomes and keep the bonds and connections critical to their well-being. 
    ...
    Portland State Child Welfare Partnership 1 
    ...
    We believe families and communities working together in a more proactive, holistic way will allow ODHS and its partners to allocate resources where they have the greatest impact for children, young adults, parents and families. Comprehensive services outside of ODHS will decrease the need for costly foster care, residential placements and other crisis support. This will create opportunities for more innovation, creative solutions and new business models. We believe when families and communities are strong, fewer children experience abuse and neglect. We recognize the importance of challenges and struggles of transforming the current system into one that is fair and just. Anti-racist principles guide us. We recognize that white supremacy and systemic racism are deeply embedded in the history, fabric and institutions of our country, including child welfare systems. Long-lasting social change comes from co from communities of color and other marginalized communities' leadership and power in social movements and systems transformation. To this end, we will leverage our resources, technical knowledge and role within the broader ODHS and child welfare systems to support transformation. Our Vision for Transformation is based on a belief that children do best growing up in a family and on values related to honoring and supporting cultural wisdom, building community resilience and voice, and ensuring the self-determination of our communities of color. The goal is an absolute transformation.

    # VISION Every child has a safe and stable family every day. ## FROM THE DIRECTOR: Several years ago, the Arkansas Division of Children & Family Services (DCFS) began a journey to strengthen the child welfare system's approach to serving children and families by implementing safety organized practice (SOP). Safety organized practice engages families, their networks, and stakeholders as collaborative partners in making decisions about their children's safety. We worked with partners across the child welfare system and created an opportunity to build on that collaboration by clearly articulating the vision and values that serve as the heart of our work. We recognized that DCFS cannot support families alone and collaboration with a family's network and DCFS' community partners are necessary for sustainability. At One Table is Arkansas's practice model representing the culmination of our collective vision that every child deserves a safe, stable, and nurturing family every day. This overview of the practice model illustrates how we work every day to translate our vision and values into DCFS' practice with children and families by providing supervisors, managers, and field staff with concrete examples of the practices that best reflect our child welfare culture. 
    ...
    # VISION Every child has a safe and stable family every day. ## DCFS PRIORITIES The Arkansas Division of Children and Family Services (DCFS) has collaboratively designed a practice framework to guide the top three priorities of the agency. 1. Safely stabilize and preserve families; and if that is not possible ... 2. Safely care for children and quickly reunify children to their families of origin. If children must be removed from the home, relative and fictive kin caregivers will be considered immediately and throughout the entire engagement with the family; and if reunification is not possible . . . 3. Safely support child permanency, well-being, and development of culturally safe, lifelong relationships. Here is a description of the image: The image shows a pattern of overlapping circles in various shades of green, with one circle in blue. The circles are arranged in rows, with a darker green band across the bottom obscuring the lower halves of the circles in that row. The background is a lighter shade of green. The circles appear to have a brushstroke texture around their edges.

    # VALUE 3 ## HELPING CHILDREN AND YOUTH ACHIEVE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL AND DEVELOP LIFELONG RELATIONSHIPS ### AGENCY PRACTICE Maintain a holistic view of the child/youth. Include and build on a family's strengths and resiliencies in order to maintain children/youth in their own home. Continuously assess safety throughout our involvement with children and families. Identify ways to lessen trauma to children/youth by using a trauma- informed perspective to promote healing. Maintain connections to important people, activities, and cultural traditions in the child/youth's life. Value placements with connections to the child/youth and family. Consider family culture when assessing permanency. 3. Identify living situations that support children and their relationships as soon as work with the family begins. 4. 5. Move toward child permanency every day. Continually focus on children's safety and well-being while they are in their own homes or in our care. Ensure the voice of the child/ youth is heard. Value the most permanent option for the child/youth, including reunification, adoption, and guardianship. Understand and value concurrent planning from day one. Establish legal permanency for children/youth, while having other support and lifelong connections in place. Value the need to have ongoing holistic needs assessments including developmental, behavioral, educational, dental, medical, psychological, etc.

    # Suggested Start Time: ## Content: Whether interviewing an adult or a child, the interview should begin with building rapport. Ask: Why is rapport building an important step in gathering information about safety? During the rapport building stage of the interview, the task is to demonstrate that you are there to listen as much as ask questions. The interview should begin by communicating that you can be respectful, have genuine curiosity for their lived experience, and are prepared to partner with them in a meaningful way. This is done through what you say in that first part but also what you do. Remember that only 7% of communication is conveyed through verbal means; the other 93% is conveyed through nonverbal means. Being aware of the messages you are sending 25 Portland State Child Welfare Partnership Essential Elements Curriculum and receiving from the moment you begin interacting with a family can go a long way. During the Engagement session on Day 2 of Essential Elements, you discussed ways to build rapport with a parent from the moment they open the door. One of those ways is through transparency in sharing information with the parent. Considering that many families may have previous experience with ODHS Child Welfare in which power and information was not shared, it is important to do this from the very beginning.

    Participants will then be admitted and someone from the training program will be there to greet them. This person will assist with getting audio and video adjusted and they will briefly review instructions. Each simulation will be 7.5 minutes long. The actors will keep track of time so participants do not need to. The actors will give a cue such as “I need to get ready for work" or "Can we be done now?" This is the cue to close out and wrap up the interview in about a minute. The initial contact and interview with the parent, Tammy Tasi, should include items discussed on the Initial Contact Cheat Sheet from Tuesday's Engagement session. The skills used in the initial contact and interview with the child, Efren Tasi, will be discussed in detail and practiced today. The allotted amount of time will also allow you to begin gathering safety related information in the six domains. This will be discussed in more detail today. Please know that you will not be expected to address all six domains or to gather enough information to make a safety decision. Once the interview is finished, a trainer will appear on screen, and there will be a few minutes to discuss the process and get feedback.

    # Content: Review the following highlights which are also listed on the Simulations Instructions and Information handout: To participate in simulations, participants will need to have both working audio and video. We suggest arriving a few minutes early to test that these are both in working order. Please contact IT support immediately if there are any concerns for this being an issue. Participants should locate the “Go Out Packet” referenced in the previous day's session on Introduction to the CPS Assessment. Ο Ο Ο There are two important documents for your simulations: the 1270 ICWA form and the 1536 CPS Assessment Pamphlet. As discussed on Tuesday during the Engagement session, you will need to provide the parent with and explain the 1536 pamphlet. You will also need to ask about American Indian or Alaskan Native involvement and explain the reason for the inquiry. The simulation will include two practice interview opportunities. Participants will be making initial contact with Tammy Tasi and Efren Tasi (15) from the Tasi case 7 Portland State Child Welfare Partnership Essential Elements Curriculum scenario. The screening report for this family can be found behind the “Screening” tab of the participant binder. Once logged into the simulation, participants can expect to be in the “waiting room" for a brief period while the person ahead finishes their simulation.

    # What does family engagement mean? ## Content: Π Family Stressors: Family stressors such as an illness in the family, unemployment, or strained relationships could be a barrier to engagement. When people are in crisis or don't have their immediate needs met, it can be hard to fully engage. Position in society or socio-economic status: Social class differences can create gaps in understanding and connection. People who live in poverty may feel like they are misunderstood by people who are not living in poverty; they are focusing on survival, so when we ask them to engage in services it's the last thing on their mind. They may live in the moment and have difficulty thinking ahead to the future. People of high-socio economic status may feel that their problems are not to be shared with a social service agency. They may feel like they have the # Portland State Child Welfare Partnership Essential Elements Curriculum situation under control and are put off by our involvement. Cultural Norms & Formalities: Individuals have different norms around greetings and rapport building. Do we shake hands, kiss someone's cheek or give them a pat on the shoulder? What's proper? It's hard to know unless you have knowledge of someone's culture, so let them lead the way.

    Follow-up: What could a worker do to address this parent's fears and strive to lessen the impact of the disadvantages the parent faces? o The ODHS Child Welfare Vision for Transformation states, "We value fairness, equity, inclusion, accessibility, diversity, and transparency in our work.” What would it look like to treat this family more equitably? What could the worker have done differently? o The Vision for Transformation also states, "We value the voices, experiences, cultures, intellect and uniqueness of Here's a description of the image: The image shows the logo for the "Portland State Child Welfare Partnership". The logo consists of a green, stylized symbol resembling a four-leaf clover or a cross with intertwined elements. To the right of the symbol is the text "Portland State" in a dark, serif font on the top line, and "Child Welfare Partnership" in a green, sans-serif font on the bottom line. Essential Elements Curriculum the children and families we serve.” What could a worker do in this scenario to show that they value and honor the family's voice and culture? Trainer Note: After the large group discussion, remind participants that they will go into Learning Teams in breakout rooms to consider the second scenario. Slide 13

    We understand that this simulation can be nerve-wracking in ideal circumstances, and we hope that by going through these materials you will feel as at ease as possible in the online format. The simulation will include two brief interviews, one with a parent, "Tammy Tasi" and the second with a child, "Efren Tasi.” Please refer to the Tasi screening report for all available case information. Each interview will include a seven-minute interaction, this includes an introduction and one additional minute for closing the interview. Our actors will monitor time, you will not need to. Our actors will let you know when it is time to move into closing by stating ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF CHILD WELFARE PRACTICE 12/15/2024something like, "I need to get to work" and "can we be done talking now.” Participants are not expected to be able to cover all six domains or reach a safety decision in seven minutes with the parent or child but are expected to ask questions related to some domains and safety as it presents itself in the interview. Primarily we are looking for a demonstration of engagement skills, listening skills, rapport building, and ability to make our parent and child feel at ease and heard.

    Nota: Utiliza esta última opción solo si no hay preocupación por el peligro inmediato. Considera siempre los requisitos para un contacto inicial; debes hacer esfuerzos diligentes para cumplir con los plazos de contacto requeridos en fin de garantizar la seguridad de los niños. Si una persona no quiere tener una conversación o si tú no te sientes seguro en cualquier momento, está bien alejarse de la situación. Llama a tu supervisor tan pronto cuando regreses a tu automóvil para recibir más instrucciones. Dependiendo de la inquietud, es posible que tu supervisor quiera que llames a la policía para obtener ayuda. Ten en cuenta que la mayoría de las reacciones se pueden abordar exitosamente cuando tratamos a las personas con respeto y empatía y brindar información sobre el proceso. Pregúntate: "¿Por qué estamos en su puerta? "¿Cuáles son sus derechos en este proceso?" y / o "¿Qué haremos con la información que nos proporcionan?” Portland State Child Welfare Partnership 2 ☐ Proporcionar y revisar el DHS 1536 Antes de salir de casa, proporciona a los padres una copia del 1536 y dedica tiempo a leer el folleto con los padres para asegurarte de que estén al tanto de sus derechos. Sea transparente con los padres sobre lo que pueden esperar de ti durante la evaluación de CPS.

    Keep in mind that most reactions can be navigated successfully when we treat people with respect and empathy and provide information about the process.

    # Parent Panel Worksheet Use this handout to take notes during the parent panel and jot down questions you have for the panelists. Protective Factors mitigate risk and promote healthy development and well-being for all children and families. Everyone benefits when protective factors are built and bolstered. Parental Resilience: managing stress and functioning well- facilitated by individual, relational, community, or societal factors-when faced with stressors, adversity, or trauma. Social Connections: healthy, meaningful, trusting, and sustained relationships with people, institutions, communities, or a higher power that promote a sense of connectedness, belonging, and mattering. Knowledge of Parenting and Child Development: learning about prenatal, infant, and child development, and using developmentally and contextually appropriate parenting practices.Portland State Child Welfare Partnership1 The image lists three concepts: 1. Social and Emotional Competence of Children: providing environments and experiences-grounded in early relational health— that build positive social skills; enable children to regulate thoughts, emotions, and behaviors; and promote effective communication, problem-solving, and decision-making skills. 2. Concrete Support: identifying, accessing, advocating for, and receiving high quality and equitable support including the basic necessities everyone deserves and specialized services to address specific needs.
