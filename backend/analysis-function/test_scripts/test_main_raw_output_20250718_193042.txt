Time spent in this area can create a valuable return on investment later on in the interview when gathering abuse specific information. Introducing and explaining the process: We need to let children know who we are right away. We share our name and affiliation. An example might be; \"Hi, my name is I work for a place called child welfare. My job is to help children and families. I work with all kinds of kids and families and talk to them at home or at school. I ask a lot of questions and talk to lots of people. But before I start, do you have any questions for me?\" Asking Permission: Children should know that they have a choice to talk with us or not talk with us. Of course, we want them to talk with us so that we can ensure their safety, but we do not want them to feel that they are being held against their will. Checking in with the child: “What were you just doing?\" It's important to know if we are interrupting something important in the child/teens day. \n...\nNote that the Cooper case is a domestic violence case and there are special considerations in making initial contact including: *Explore how to do the assessment when the alleged batterer is not home. If possible, call first to determine who is at home and how safe it is go to the home. *Consider meeting at a DHS Self-Sufficiency office, school or other neutral setting. *Immediately ask the alleged adult victim if it is safe to conduct an interview and, if not, ask what might be a safe way. *Never ask the alleged adult victim about domestic violence in front of the alleged batterer. Disclosures may make the alleged adult victim unsafe if the alleged batterer is in the vicinity. These suggestions are taken from the Child Welfare Practices for Cases with Domestic Violence. Case practice in cases involving domestic violence will be discussed more in Week 2 of training.

Each partner should choose one of four case scenarios and decide who will play the role of the caseworker first. As the caseworker, they should practice the following elements: *   Knock on the door *   Introduce yourself *   Verify you are speaking to the correct person *   Explain the reason for contact (be clear and transparent about the concern!) *   Ask where the parent would like to speak more *   Find out if anyone else is in the home *   Begin asking about the report \n...\nSharing information and rights through the 1536 pamphlet Video demonstrator of skills Practicing initial contact skills # Portland State Child Welfare Partnership # Essential Elements Curriculum "}}, {"_array_index": 3, "_citation_number": 4, "retrieved_context": {"title": "8_PPT_Gathering_Info_SW_2024-02-15", "uri": "gs://wz-case-worker-mentor-rag/Curriculum/4__Gathering_Information/4__Participant_Material_Handouts/7_Gathering_Information/8_PPT_Gathering_Info_SW_2024-02-15.pdf", "text": "*   Pay attention to your time slot and make sure you have your Zoom Link. *   You will arrive into a waiting room, you will be given instruction by the facilitators. *   7.5 minutes and then actors will let you know it is time to wrap up. *   You will get feedback from a trainer. 3 Essential Elements of Child Welfare Practice Week 1: Gathering Info for the CPS Assessment 1 Here's a description of the image, including the facts and conclusions that can be derived from it: **Overall Content:** The image appears to be a slide or handout from a training or educational session.

It is vital that communication with teens be understandable and meaningful. It is important to have developmentally appropriate materials created for teens that explain the child welfare system and how to navigate it. It's also vital for teens to have the plans and expectations of the agency simply and carefully explained in a variety of ways – i.e., in written, visual and oral form. Using technology could be particularly effective (i.e., Internet, video, iPod downloads, etc.) It is important to note that housing is a particularly difficult problem for teens, especially when abusive parents or the batterer have been the source of financial support. It is very hard for teens to access any housing without cosigners. The issue of family of origin abuse can also be a barrier in accessing shelter services if parental consent is needed. In addition, a teen cannot get a restraining order without a guardian.CHILD WELFARE PRACTICES FOR CASES WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE # Back to TOC Some interventions that are especially useful for teens include expressive arts like journaling, drama, painting and poetry.
