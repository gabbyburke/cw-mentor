THINKING: **Evaluating the Task**

I'm now clear on the task: dissect the parent interview transcript, and give feedback as a social work educator, keeping Arkansas child welfare training and best practices in mind. I need to focus my responses on the transcript itself.


THINKING: **Outlining the Analysis**

I've started to parse the transcript to note the interactive behaviors. Each interaction will be assessed against the key assessment criteria. I am now structuring a JSON framework to house the feedback and the suggested training. I've began the analysis of the first several lines, and the mental walkthrough looks promising.


THINKING: **Planning the Approach**

I've broken down the user's task into manageable components. I need to understand the goal, dissect the requirements, and then create a plan to approach the problem. I've outlined a basic structure, including the mental walkthrough of the first four lines of the transcript, which suggests a good start. Now, the structure is being created, and I will soon begin formulating feedback.


THINKING: **Developing the Structure**

I'm currently fleshing out the JSON structure, based on the initial criteria mapping and feedback generation. I've tested the structure on the first four interactions in the transcript, and all of that has proved successful. Now I'm working on building a detailed outline that can be scaled easily.


THINKING: **Developing a Solution**

I've completed the initial walkthrough and feedback generation for the first four interactions. This is now being converted into a flexible template for the rest of the transcript. I'm also working on identifying the specific Arkansas training materials to cite. The JSON structure is almost complete.


THINKING: **Developing the Analysis**

I'm working on the deeper analysis of the transcript now, expanding on the initial assessment. I'm diving into the nuances of the parent-worker interactions, paying close attention to language choices. My JSON structure is ready, and I'm mapping observed behaviors to best practices, looking for opportunities for constructive, supportive feedback.


THINKING: **Refining the Plan**

I've finalized the JSON structure, incorporating the criteria, feedback, and suggestions for improvement. I'm developing the Arkansas training resources to cite and will use those to make sure my responses align with Arkansas child welfare standards. I'm ready to input the full JSON data, then deliver the output.

   Chunk 1: Parent_Interview_Assessment_Info_for_Google
   Text: # Parent Interview Assessment ## At the Door/Initial Contact: 2. Reason for contact was stated in a way that was responsive to the parent and stated in a way that clearly identified the child safety concern without using inflammatory language. Reason for Contact: When we take the time to consider how we can clearly and empathetically articulate child safety concerns with the human being standing in front of us, before asking to enter their home, we are honoring them in multiple ways. First, we are sharing power through providing clear and specific reasons why child welfare has chosen to intervene in their lives. Second, when we avoid the use of inflammatory language we are not only respectful of the impact of such language, but also setting aside judgment allowing us to embrace a lens of curiosity Finally, by clearly articulating the reason for our contact before asking to enter into conversation, or their home, we are respecting their right to say, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù This relates to the principles of Everyone Desires Respect, Judgements Can Wait and Partners Share Power. 3. Responded to parent's needs, current concerns and questions. For example, did responded to Tami asking for further clarification or repeating of ‚Äúwhy are you here?" without defensiveness. 
...
# Gathering Information 6. After entering Tami's home, started with stating the reason for contact using clear language that Tami understood. Start with Reason for Contact. When entering into a parent's home, it is respectful to communicate why you are there in a way that the parent can understand. Withholding or distracting from such information increases the power differential. Therefore, immediately sharing this information with the parent aligns with the principles Partners Share Power and Everyone Desires Respect. 7. Response to the parent when they express a need to talk about why a Child Welfare worker is there utilizes the Principles of Partnership and empowers the parent to lead the conversation. Parent Communication of Needs. When making initial contact, it is likely that the parent will want to address the reason you are there prior to discussing other topics. The principles, Partners Share Power and Judgments Can Wait are a reminder to pay attention to what verbal and nonverbal responses are communicating, to meet the parent where they are at, and to withhold preconceived notions based on a report. 8. Worker demonstrated curiosity and encouraged parent to share their story. Give Opportunity for Parent to Share. 
...
# Parent Interview Assessment ## At the Door/Initial Contact: Ask if Anyone Else is Present. When we ask if anyone else is present in the home we are most clearly honoring the principle that everyone desires respect. It is a practice that is respectful of the individual to whom we are speaking. If we learn that someone else is in the home, we can then ask, at least, one of two types of questions. First, is there somewhere we can talk so that we will not be overheard (honoring an individual's right to a private conversation). Second, is that someone who you wish to be a part of this conversation or is a support to the family (honoring familial or cultural practices around including elders of other significant individuals in important conversations). Finally, asking if someone else is in the home is a practice of respecting yourself. Knowing who is in the home can help you to make informed decisions about how to best ensure your own personal safety and well-being as you perform duties. 
...
Taking Time to Respond: When we engage empathetically we are not only listening to the words, but the deeper meanings that are being shared in the moment. Those deeper meanings are often conveyed through various forms of body language. When we are receptive to the fully embodied message of the speaker in front of us we are honoring the principle that everyone needs to be heard and understood. Further, understanding not only involves the practice of listening, but the art of asking questions from a place of curiosity. When we practice listening and questioning in these ways, in all of our interactions, we are honoring the principle that Partnership is a Process. 4. Asked and received permission to enter the home without coercion Permission to Enter: By asking for permission and respecting their decision whether to enter their home, we are respecting their right to say, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù This relates to the principles of Everyone Desires Respect and Partners Share Power. 5. Asked if anyone else was present in the home 
...
# Parent Interview Assessment The Principles of Partnership are the foundation for engagement and have application throughout interviews with parents. As you reflect on your interview keep these in mind. The Principles of Partnership are: Everyone Desires Respect Everyone Needs to Be Heard Everyone Has Strengths Judgements Can Wait Partners Share Power Partnership is a Process ## Introduction: 1. Worker identified themself by stating their first name, last name, agency's full title (Oregon Department of Human Services Child Welfare), parent's first name and last name. Introductions: When we are seeking to engage in conversation with others it is a respectful practice to fully introduce ourselves before asking anything from them. When we are representing an organization, it includes sharing the full name of our organization. By clearly identifying who we are and where we come from we are also sharing power through sharing this information. Verifying that we are speaking to the correct person, by asking for them by their full name, is not only respectful and a way of honoring their unique personhood, but also helps to protect the confidentiality of the person we seek to engage. This relates to the principles of Everyone Desires Respect and Partners Share Power.

   Chunk 2: 7_Hoja_de_Referencia_de_Contacto_Inicial_KP_2025-07-01
   Text: The image is a reference sheet titled "Hoja de Referencia de Contacto Inicial" (Initial Contact Reference Sheet). It provides guidelines for making initial contact with individuals, likely in a social work or child welfare context. The sheet includes the logo of Portland State Child Welfare Partnership. The sheet includes the following points: *   Give an appropriate greeting, such as "Hola," "Buenos d√≠as," or "Buenas tardes." *   Identify yourself by stating your name, last name, and the department you represent. Avoid using acronyms (e.g., ODHS). Show your identification and provide your business card. *   Make sure you are talking to the right person by asking them to verify their name and last name. For example, "Necesito hablar con Judith Rich, ¬øes usted la Sra. Judith Rich?" (I need to speak with Judith Rich, are you Mrs. Judith Rich?) *   State the reason for your visit using clear, concise, and non-threatening language. Avoid terms like 'abuso' (abuse), 'negligencia' (negligence), and 'l√≠nea directa de abuso infantil' (child abuse hotline). 
...
For example: "Estoy aqu√≠ para hablar con usted sobre un reporte de inquietud con respecto a sus ni√±os jugando sin supervisi√≥n en la calle," (I am here to talk to you about a report of concern regarding your children playing unsupervised in the street) or "Se hizo un informe a nuestro departamento sobre el estado de su hogar." (A report was made to our department about the state of your home.) *   Ask for permission to enter the house. For example: "¬øPuedo pasar a hablar con usted sobre el informe que recibimos?" (Can I come in to talk to you about the report we received?) Make sure to get permission before entering. Once inside, ask the person how they prefer to be addressed (i.e., Sra., Sr. name, etc.). *   Ask if anyone else is present in the house. This is important for several reasons: 1) personal safety; 2) client confidentiality; and 3) knowing if there is anyone else in the home with whom you need to speak. The page number is 1. ‚òê Abordar las reacciones que se presenten Las estrategias para abordar las reacciones incluyen: Empat√≠a ‚Äì ‚ÄúPuedo ver que usted est√° molesto. Yo tambi√©n me molestar√≠a si alguien se presentara en mi casa sin previo aviso".

A symbol resembling a medical cross is in the bottom left corner. # Portland State Child Welfare Partnership Essential Elements Curriculum o Anticipating questions ‚Äì consider the questions that parents may have when a caseworker first introduces themselves. Emphasize that the first question that many parents have is ‚Äúwhy are you here?‚Äù o Transparency about the reason for the contact and process ‚Äì providing parents with a clear, yet trauma informed, description of the reason for contact demonstrates to the parent that they can trust you to share information with them and be responsive to the questions they have. We also need to share with parents what to expect from a CPS assessment including the process and their rights. o Responsive to the parent/psychological safety/sharing power - examples of this may include asking the parent where they would like to talk, where they would like you to sit, who else is in the home, etc. o Adopt a not-knowing stance/check biases - understand that the information in the screening report is both important and does not tell the whole story. # Portland State Child Welfare Partnership Slide 15 # Essential Elements Curriculum Practicing Cultural Humility Review the screening report for your assigned case and consider the following questions: 
...
# Trauma Informed Practice Strategies ## Content: Large Group discussion: Ask the large group to share actions that a caseworker can take to demonstrate what they have learned about trauma informed practice when making initial contact with a family. The trainer should ensure the following are addressed: o Consider the tone and language you use when you call someone or the way you knock on someone's door. o Validating emotions ‚Äì Consider the wide range of emotions a parent/caregiver may be experiencing when child welfare makes contact. We may see people who are angry, frustrated, fearful, crying, defensive or even indifferent. It's important to recognize emotions or reactions of the individuals we encounter. We do this through clarification and validation. Here is a description of the image: The image shows two women in what appears to be a casual conversation. One woman, who is the main focus, has dark curly hair pulled up in a bun and is wearing a light blue denim shirt. She is holding a mug in her hand and looking towards the other woman with a slight smile. The second woman is partially visible, with only the side of her face and hair (which is blonde and also in a bun) in view. The background suggests they are near a window with vertical blinds.

   Text: # Gathering Information for the Comprehensive CPS Assessment Last updated by: Sheila Warren, 02/06/2024 Participants will learn how to gather information for the six domains and how comprehensive information and critical thinking leads to safety decisions. This session will reinforce the critical role of engaging families in achieving safe outcomes for children and how cultural factors, worker bias and authority can impact gathering information. Participants will practice strengths-based interviewing and rapport building strategies. They will also learn how their own actions and words can impact a parent or child's ability and willingness to share information. Through case scenarios and role playing, participants will develop skills in trauma informed interviewing practice Time: 6 Hours, 30 minutes Recommended Class Size: Approx. 30 ## Learning Objectives: Identify the information that needs to be gathered related to each of the six domains and the sources from which it can be gathered Know how to use strengths based, trauma-informed, and culturally responsive interviewing strategies with children and families involved in the CPS assessment process Know strategies to engage with a child in a legally sound interview process based on development, age and cognitive ability ## Materials: 1 Simulation Instructions and Information (SW 02.15.2024) 2 Self Paced Learning (SW 05.16.2023) 3 Working Respectfully with Families (SW 11.02.2023)

# Suggested Start Time: ## Content: Whether interviewing an adult or a child, the interview should begin with building rapport. Ask: Why is rapport building an important step in gathering information about safety? During the rapport building stage of the interview, the task is to demonstrate that you are there to listen as much as ask questions. The interview should begin by communicating that you can be respectful, have genuine curiosity for their lived experience, and are prepared to partner with them in a meaningful way. This is done through what you say in that first part but also what you do. Remember that only 7% of communication is conveyed through verbal means; the other 93% is conveyed through nonverbal means. Being aware of the messages you are sending 25 Portland State Child Welfare Partnership Essential Elements Curriculum and receiving from the moment you begin interacting with a family can go a long way. During the Engagement session on Day 2 of Essential Elements, you discussed ways to build rapport with a parent from the moment they open the door. One of those ways is through transparency in sharing information with the parent. Considering that many families may have previous experience with ODHS Child Welfare in which power and information was not shared, it is important to do this from the very beginning. 
...
# Content: Another important part of rapport building with children is to engage the child in talking about something that interests them or is important to them. There are various ways to do this. One method is called narrative practice which you read about in the self-directed learning this morning. Narrative practice is an opportunity to get to know the child, show interest, and gauge the child's ability to recall an event. Utilizing this interview strategy includes asking a child to share a recent event that they had, like a birthday, a sleep over, a field trip, a holiday, and share all the information that they can remember from this 30 Portland State # Child Welfare Partnership Essential Elements Curriculum event. Narrative practice and developmental assessment refers to asking the child questions that help you determine how they function developmentally. By asking the child to tell you about an event or something that is important to them, you will be able to assess the child's communication style. You can determine how well the child articulates a story and how they do with sequencing of events. Œü Œü An example of an initial rapport building question might be: ‚ÄúI'm here to learn more about you. What are some of your favorite hobbies/things to do?"

# Closing the Interview ## Content: The final stage of any interview includes taking time to provide closure. As you end the interview you must attend to the knowledge this could have been an awkward and potentially traumatic encounter for a child or parent. Plan to close the interview through including these steps. Allowing for any questions ‚Äì Create time and space for this and prepare to ask children and parents if they have any questions. Do not be surprised if they do not immediately have questions but then have some later. It can be helpful to have question suggestions ready to help get this conversation going. 62 Portland State Child Welfare Partnership Essential Elements Curriculum Next Steps - Many families do not know our process. Whether this is an assessment only, you need to gather more information, or are taking court action you should be prepared to explain the next steps even if the family or child does not ask. In a developmentally appropriate way, be clear, be honest, and be open about what this means and the potential outcomes Œü Œü Next steps can include when you will see them again and what future contacts may look like.

   Text: # Self-Paced Learning ## #4: Introduction and Building Rapport with Children Just like your introduction or greeting with a parent, there are some steps to include when building a trusting relationship with a child. Time spent in this area can create a valuable return on investment later on in the interview when gathering abuse specific information. Introducing and explaining the process: We need to let children know who we are right away. We share our name and affiliation. An example might be; "Hi, my name is I work for a place called child welfare. My job is to help children and families. I work with all kinds of kids and families and talk to them at home or at school. I ask a lot of questions and talk to lots of people. But before I start, do you have any questions for me?" Asking Permission: Children should know that they have a choice to talk with us or not talk with us. Of course, we want them to talk with us so that we can ensure their safety, but we do not want them to feel that they are being held against their will. Checking in with the child: ‚ÄúWhat were you just doing?" It's important to know if we are interrupting something important in the child/teens day. 
...
Note that the Cooper case is a domestic violence case and there are special considerations in making initial contact including: *Explore how to do the assessment when the alleged batterer is not home. If possible, call first to determine who is at home and how safe it is go to the home. *Consider meeting at a DHS Self-Sufficiency office, school or other neutral setting. *Immediately ask the alleged adult victim if it is safe to conduct an interview and, if not, ask what might be a safe way. *Never ask the alleged adult victim about domestic violence in front of the alleged batterer. Disclosures may make the alleged adult victim unsafe if the alleged batterer is in the vicinity. These suggestions are taken from the Child Welfare Practices for Cases with Domestic Violence. Case practice in cases involving domestic violence will be discussed more in Week 2 of training. How would you share information about the report of concern with Sara Cooper, after confirming that the alleged perpetrator of domestic violence is not present?

# Self-Paced Learning ## #4: Introduction and Building Rapport with Children 1. Practice individually how you would say your introduction, describing your role, and going through the instructions of the interview 2. What questions do you have about the introduction, describing your role, and going over instructions? Read the article about Narrative Practice using the link below OR by locating the article in your binder. As you read, write down a question you have or make note of something that stands out to you. Narrative Practice (What is it and Why is it Important?): 1. What questions or comments do you have about narrative practice? 2. How would you start narrative practice with Daniel Rich? (The screening report can be found for review using this link or in the screening tab of your binder) # #5: Developmentally Appropriate Interviews Different workers will have different interviewing styles. No matter your style, you always need to ensure you are moving through the above steps with every child (even teens!) With that, you will also need to make adjustments based on the age and development of the child. This idea will be explored further in the third week and in Wellbeing training, but each time you interact with a child, you have to consider how to intervene in a developmentally appropriate way. 
...
If interviewing a child at school and they were just getting ready to go to lunch, they may not want to talk with us. Instructions: letting the child know what is expected, so there are no surprises. Setting rules for the interview should also help put the child at ease. (reference the tips and rules half sheet included here and found in the back pocket of your binder) Notes: An important part of the introduction is to also let children know that we will be taking notes. One way to do this is to say, ‚ÄúWhile we are talking, I am going to be taking notes, because what you have to say is very important, and I don't want to forget." Rapport Building/ Narrative Practice: The last step of building rapport is to engage the child talking about something that interests them or is important to them. There are various ways to do this. One method is called a practice narrative. This rapport-building strategy utilizes an opportunity to get to know the child, show interest, and gauge the child's ability to recall an event.

   Chunk 10: 9_Child_Interviewing_Guide_SW_2023-05-16
   Text: # Child Interviewing Guide The following provides suggestions on how to begin an interview, questions to ask, and ways to close the interview. This list is not all inclusive and should not be used exclusively when interviewing children. Questions will need to be adapted based on the individual child's age and/or development ## Phase I: Introduction, Instructions and Rapport Building ‚òê ## ‚òê Verify you are speaking to the correct child ### Introduce yourself and identify the agency (avoid acronyms) Provide your first and last name, your pronouns, and the department which you represent. Do not use acronyms to avoid confusion. For example, ‚ÄúHi, my name is I use pronouns. I work for the Oregon Department of Human Services, Child Welfare." Whether you are interviewing a child at school or at home, it's best practice to confirm you are speaking to the correct child by confirming their first and last name. This is also a good opportunity to ask the child if they prefer to go by a different name or have a nickname. It is good practice to also verify the child's pronouns after introducing your own.‚òê Explain your role‚òê ‚òê Remind the child that you work for Child Welfare. Consider asking the child if they have heard of Child Welfare and if so, what they know. 
...
# Child Interviewing Guide ## Ask the child if they have questions or concerns Allow the child to discuss topics/issues/concerns he or she feels are important, including topics not previously addressed. This provides the child with the opportunity to communicate information that they deem as important, which could be something the interview questions did not address or information that the child did not relate to questions that were asked. "Are there any questions that I forgot to ask you today?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there anything else you think is important for me to know today?‚Äù Give the child an opportunity to ask questions. Answer questions honestly, providing information if able. Do not make promises or guarantees as to what may or may not occur after the interview. Continue to share power by sharing information with the child about what will happen next. This includes if and when they may see you again, who else you may talk to as a part of the assessment, etc. Make an effort to transition the child to a discussion of neutral topics prior to leaving the interview room. This may include talking with the child about their plans following the interview or other topics discussed during the rapport building stage of the interview. This process may vary in length depending upon the child's needs. 
...
For example, "I'd like to get to know you better. Tell me about yourself‚Äù or ‚ÄúTell me things you like to do for fun [hobbies, interests, etc.]" Use open-ended questions, follow up prompts, requests for clarification and attentive listening to demonstrate genuine interest and to begin narrative practice. Narrative practice involves using open-ended questions/prompts to ask the child to tell about a neutral, salient event or topic. Encourage the child to tell you all about the event or topic, with great detail. Questions might include: "Tell me about your last [salient event such as birthday, vacation, etc].‚Äù ‚ÄúTell me everything that happened.‚Äù ‚ÄúTell me what happened from the beginning to the end." Narrative practice increases the child's comfort level and facilitates rapport building. It allows the interviewer to assess the child's developmental level, cognitive functioning, and language abilities. It also establishes the precedent that the child provides narrative responses to the interviewer's questions. Conducting a practice narrative using open-ended questions increases the amount of reliable information the child provides later in the interview. 
...
# Child Interviewing Guide ## Provide Instructions for the Interview Caseworkers should provide instructions in all child interviews, whether interviewing a young child or a teenager. Instructions are an important way toESSENTIAL ELEMENTS WK 1 GATHERING INFORMATION1 5/16/2023 share power and to let the youth know what they can expect from you and what you are asking of them. Research indicates that providing instructions reduces children's suggestibility and enhances resistance to misleading questions. Instructions include: Œü Œü Œü Tell the truth ‚Äì don't guess It's okay to say "I don't know" Let me know if you don't understand a question Œü Correct me if I get something wrong Œü Œü Let me know if something is hard to talk about You can be done with the interview or take a break at any time ### ‚òê Notes ‚òê An important part of the introduction is to also let children know that we will be taking notes. One way to do this is to say, ‚ÄúWhile we are talking, I am going to be taking notes, because what you have to say is very important, and I don't want to forget." ## Build Rapport/Narrative Practice Transition to rapport building by asking the child about their interests or by asking the child what they were doing before you met with them. 
...
Depending on the child's response, provide any clarification and continue on to explain the role of the caseworker, emphasizing the role in assessing safety. Examples may include: "I have a really cool job where I get to talk to lots of kids and families. It's part of my job to talk about safety." "My job is to talk to kids and teens and their families about safety. I ask questions about you and your family." ## Ask the child for permission to interview them It is important to ask the child for permission following an explanation of the caseworker's role. This ensures fully informed consent. Caseworkers should also consider sharing power by asking the child where they would like the caseworker to sit and if it is an okay time for the interview.

# Take a Stand Prompts What was your thought process in selecting "agree‚Äù or "disagree" for each statement? How did it feel being made to take a stand based on the information provided? A parent raised in a family with intergenerational abuse will be less likely to adequately parent a child. A non-offending parent who does not believe that child sexual abuse occurred cannot protect the child. A parent who is abusing substances cannot provide adequate care and protection for their child. A parent who is not taking prescribed medication for a diagnosed mental illness cannot safely care for their child. Survivors should be held as accountable as perpetrators for keeping children safe from domestic violence. 15 Suggested Start Time and (Duration): 11:38 (12 min) Materials/Links: N/A Content: ‚Üë Small Group Breakout Room (5 min.): Once the poll is complete, send the Learning Teams to break out rooms for 5 minutes to discuss their experience of being made to answer one way or another. Explain that there is no requirement to disclose their answers, but rather it is an opportunity to discuss how they made their decision and what it felt like. o Share instruction/prompt slide to breakout rooms.

   Text: Explore how to do the assessment when the alleged batterer is not home. If possible, call first to determine who is at home and how safe it is go to the home. Find out the alleged batterer's work schedule. Consider meeting at a DHS Self-Sufficiency office, school or other neutral setting. Develop an alternate plan in the event you are unable to interview the adults separately. If you believe that an interview with the alleged batterer (or another family member) at initial contact will compromise safety of any family member, consult with a supervisor to request an exception to interviewing the alleged perpetrator at initial contact in order to allow for safety planning before the interview. If you have to make contact when the alleged batterer is or may be present, take two workers, a police officer or parole/probation worker if assigned. Responding with assistance promotes worker safety and can assist in conducting separate interviews. Have information readily accessible on available domestic violence services and other emergency resources. If possible, consult with domestic violence programs or batterer intervention specialists before responding. Advocates can offer in-depth domestic violence safety planning and information about resources and information about domestic violence dynamics. Please refer to the Resource Section for domestic violence safety planning and for information on batterer intervention programs. 
...
# Engagement without collusion ## Assessment questions for the children Adapt your questioning to the developmental age of the child. Talk to the child about ways to stay safe as possible. As in any child interview, start with questions to develop rapport, and use the child's language. Ask general questions first. Who lives or stays in your home (including pets)? Who visits? What things do you do with your mom? What things do you do with your dad? What's your favorite thing about your mom? Is there anything about your mom that makes you sad, scared or worried? What's your favorite thing about your dad? Is there anything about your dad that makes you sad, scared or worried? What are the rules in your house? Are any specific rules just for your mom or dad? If the child discloses violence, follow up with clarifying questions to define terms and determine what happened. Does anyone hit, shove, push or throw things? Who does that? Tell me about the last time that happened. When this happened, what did you do? What did other family members (including pets) do? Has anyone been hurt? Who was there? What happened next? (Follow up with specifics about police, doctors, etc.)

The PCA then determines whether the parents and the Department can agree on what change is needed. Domestic violence may not have been initially identified as a present danger safety threat or impending danger safety threat in the assessment process when other abuse and neglect issues were present. Building rapport with the adult victim during the PCA can facilitate the sharing of information about domestic violence. This discovery can lead to a change in the ongoing safety plan and in the conditions for return. The following material relates to families for which domestic violence has specifically been identified as an impending danger safety threat; in other words, one or both parents' or caregivers' behavior is violent and/or they are acting (behaving) dangerously. Other impending danger safety threats and diminished protective capacities may also exist in families where domestic violence is present.CHILD WELFARE PRACTICES FOR CASES WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE58 # Back to TOC There are four stages in the initial PCA: preparation, introduction, exploration, and change strategy and case planning. The first stage is undertaken by the caseworker to thoughtfully prepare to engage the parents in the process. The second stage is intended to introduce the concepts of the PCA to the parents and to request their willingness to engage in the process.

   Chunk 17: Protective_Factors_Conversation_Guide_Knowledge_of_Parenting
   Text: Œ†  It is natural to parent our children the way our parents did or to try to avoid repeating our parents' mistakes. Œ†  Ask: How do you think the way you were parented influences your parenting decisions? No parent can know everything. All parents need advice at times. Œ†  Ask: Where do you go when you have questions about parenting? (e.g., family, media, teachers, friends, books) Offer resources where they could get expert advice, such as parenting classes or online sources (e.g., CDC, Raising the Future, healthychildren.org, or Abriendo Puertas/Opening Doors). It takes time to change habits, but it is never too late to try something new. Œ†  Encourage parents to commit to one small change. Ask: What do you think will work best for your child and family? _END_OF_TABLE_

   Chunk 18: 2_Life_of_a_Case_KP_2025-07-01
   Text: Here is a description of the image: The image is a flowchart titled "Life of a Case," outlining the process of a child welfare case. The process begins with the "Oregon Child Abuse Hotline (Screening Assessment)." This leads to either "Closed at Screening No allegation of Abuse" or "Assigned to CPS Worker (24HR, 72HR, 10 Day)." If assigned to a CPS worker, the next step is "Initial Family Contact," which branches into "Present Danger Identified" or "6 Domains Comprehensive Assessment." If "Present Danger Identified," the next step is "Protective Action." If "6 Domains Comprehensive Assessment," it leads to "High to Moderate Needs Identified. Services Offered" or "Safety Threat Identified. Safety Threshold Criteria." "High to Moderate Needs Identified. Services Offered" leads to "No Impending Danger" or continues to the next step. "No Impending Danger" leads to "Case Closed." "Protective Action" and "Safety Threat Identified. Safety Threshold Criteria" both lead to "Initial safety plan," followed by "Co-Case Management Identification 48 HRS." The next step is "Preparation Meeting Conditions for Return PCA Stage 1," which branches into "CPS" and "PERM."
