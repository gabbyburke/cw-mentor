Ask: Why is rapport building an important step in gathering information about safety? During the rapport building stage of the interview, the task is to demonstrate that you are there to listen as much as ask questions. The interview should begin by communicating that you can be respectful, have genuine curiosity for their lived experience, and are prepared to partner with them in a meaningful way. This is done through what you say in that first part but also what you do. Remember that only 7% of communication is conveyed through verbal means; the other 93% is conveyed through nonverbal means. Being aware of the messages you are sending 25 Portland State Child Welfare Partnership Essential Elements Curriculum and receiving from the moment you begin interacting with a family can go a long way. During the Engagement session on Day 2 of Essential Elements, you discussed ways to build rapport with a parent from the moment they open the door. One of those ways is through transparency in sharing information with the parent. Considering that many families may have previous experience with ODHS Child Welfare in which power and information was not shared, it is important to do this from the very beginning. "

This list is not all inclusive and should not be used exclusively when interviewing children. Questions will need to be adapted based on the individual child's age and/or development ## Phase I: Introduction, Instructions and Rapport Building ☐ ## ☐ Verify you are speaking to the correct child ### Introduce yourself and identify the agency (avoid acronyms) Provide your first and last name, your pronouns, and the department which you represent. Do not use acronyms to avoid confusion. For example, “Hi, my name is I use pronouns. I work for the Oregon Department of Human Services, Child Welfare.\" Whether you are interviewing a child at school or at home, it's best practice to confirm you are speaking to the correct child by confirming their first and last name. This is also a good opportunity to ask the child if they prefer to go by a different name or have a nickname. It is good practice to also verify the child's pronouns after introducing your own.☐ Explain your role☐ ☐ Remind the child that you work for Child Welfare. Consider asking the child if they have heard of Child Welfare and if so, what they know. \n...\n# Child Interviewing Guide ## Ask the child if they have questions or concerns Allow the child to discuss topics/issues/concerns he or she feels are important, including topics not previously addressed. This provides the child with the opportunity to communicate information that they deem as important, which could be something the interview questions did not address or information that the child did not relate to questions that were asked. \"Are there any questions that I forgot to ask you today?” “Is there anything else you think is important for me to know today?” Give the child an opportunity to ask questions. Answer questions honestly, providing information if able. Do not make promises or guarantees as to what may or may not occur after the interview. Continue to share power by sharing information with the child about what will happen next. This includes if and when they may see you again, who else you may talk to as a part of the assessment, etc. Make an effort to transition the child to a discussion of neutral topics prior to leaving the interview room. This may include talking with the child about their plans following the interview or other topics discussed during the rapport building stage of the interview. This process may vary in length depending upon the child's needs. "

              "text": "# Engagement without collusion ## Assessment questions for the children Adapt your questioning to the developmental age of the child. Talk to the child about ways to stay safe as possible. As in any child interview, start with questions to develop rapport, and use the child's language. Ask general questions first. Who lives or stays in your home (including pets)? Who visits? What things do you do with your mom? What things do you do with your dad? What's your favorite thing about your mom? Is there anything about your mom that makes you sad, scared or worried? What's your favorite thing about your dad? Is there anything about your dad that makes you sad, scared or worried? What are the rules in your house? Are any specific rules just for your mom or dad? If the child discloses violence, follow up with clarifying questions to define terms and determine what happened. Does anyone hit, shove, push or throw things? Who does that? Tell me about the last time that happened. When this happened, what did you do? What did other family members (including pets) do? Has anyone been hurt? Who was there? What happened next? (Follow up with specifics about police, doctors, etc.) \n...\n# Developing written plans and mandating services Protective action plans, initial safety plans, ongoing safety plans, case plans and mandated services should be developmentally appropriate. It is vital that communication with teens be understandable and meaningful. It is important to have developmentally appropriate materials created for teens that explain the child welfare system and how to navigate it. It's also vital for teens to have the plans and expectations of the agency simply and carefully explained in a variety of ways – i.e., in written, visual and oral form. Using technology could be particularly effective (i.e., Internet, video, iPod downloads, etc.) It is important to note that housing is a particularly difficult problem for teens, especially when abusive parents or the batterer have been the source of financial support. It is very hard for teens to access any housing without cosigners. The issue of family of origin abuse can also be a barrier in accessing shelter services if parental consent is needed. In addition, a teen cannot get a restraining order without a guardian.CHILD WELFARE PRACTICES FOR CASES WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE # Back to TOC Some interventions that are especially useful for teens include expressive arts like journaling, drama, painting and poetry. According to the National Crime Prevention Council: Sometimes adults struggle to explain complex concepts in a way that teens will understand. "

Both ODHS and Portland State leadership have made it explicit that our institutions stand in solidarity with communities of color. Director Fariborz, ODHS and Dean Coll, PSU have not only made clear statements but have provided concrete examples on ways in which we can take action. Here at the Child Welfare Partnership, equity is at the center of our mission and vision. We envision a child welfare system that honors the resilience of black, brown and indigenous families, one that works in solidarity with communities to keep children and young people safe, and families together. However, we have a long way to go to make this vision real. Child Welfare has a long history of harm to communities of color. It is our mission to work on that, and to write a new future together with you starting training here today. Specifically, as trainers, we are constantly working to improve our skills in interrupting racism as it occurs and bring all of us along our learning path. We regularly review our curriculum to unpack and eliminate racism when we find it. As a team, we are at work on our own learning and growth. "

A big part of embracing this protective factor is acknowledging that parenting can be hard, and perfection is not expected or necessary. Social and Emotional Competence of Children: providing environments and experiences-grounded in early relational health- that build positive social skills; enable children to regulate thoughts, emotions, and behaviors; and promote effective communication, problem-solving, and decision-making skills. These skills do not come naturally and must be modeled and taught through experiences and environments parents and caregivers provide.

The trainer should ensure the following are addressed: o Consider the tone and language you use when you call someone or the way you knock on someone's door. o Validating emotions – Consider the wide range of emotions a parent/caregiver may be experiencing when child welfare makes contact. We may see people who are angry, frustrated, fearful, crying, defensive or even indifferent. It's important to recognize emotions or reactions of the individuals we encounter. We do this through clarification and validation. Here is a description of the image: The image shows two women in what appears to be a casual conversation. One woman, who is the main focus, has dark curly hair pulled up in a bun and is wearing a light blue denim shirt. She is holding a mug in her hand and looking towards the other woman with a slight smile.

Time spent in this area can create a valuable return on investment later on in the interview when gathering abuse specific information. Introducing and explaining the process: We need to let children know who we are right away. We share our name and affiliation. An example might be; \"Hi, my name is I work for a place called child welfare. My job is to help children and families. I work with all kinds of kids and families and talk to them at home or at school. I ask a lot of questions and talk to lots of people. But before I start, do you have any questions for me?\" Asking Permission: Children should know that they have a choice to talk with us or not talk with us. Of course, we want them to talk with us so that we can ensure their safety, but we do not want them to feel that they are being held against their will. Checking in with the child: “What were you just doing?\" It's important to know if we are interrupting something important in the child/teens day. "

First, is there somewhere we can talk so that we will not be overheard (honoring an individual's right to a private conversation). Second, is that someone who you wish to be a part of this conversation or is a support to the family (honoring familial or cultural practices around including elders of other significant individuals in important conversations).
