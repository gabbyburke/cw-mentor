THINKING: **Assessing the Task**
I'm now focusing on the key criteria for analyzing the parent interview transcript. My aim is to provide clear and specific feedback, drawing on Arkansas child welfare training materials and best practices. I need to structure my analysis effectively, ensuring the feedback is actionable and helpful.
THINKING: **Evaluating Initial Contact**
I've reviewed the first interaction, breaking down the social worker's turn-taking into the six key criteria. Initial observations include a good start to the introduction, but it lacks specifics regarding agency affiliation, and the identity presentation. The reason for contact is clear and includes the children's names, which helps focus the conversation.
THINKING: **Defining the Approach**
I'm now working on formalizing the evaluation criteria to systematically review the initial interview segment. I'm outlining specific points for each of the six categories, referencing training guidelines to ensure my analysis aligns with the best practices in Arkansas child welfare. I want to ensure that all elements are covered with thoroughness.
THINKING: **Dissecting the Exchange**
I'm now parsing the initial two turns of the exchange, meticulously identifying key behaviors within each of the six pre-defined categories. I'm noting how the social worker introduces themselves and addresses the parent's concerns, and how the parent responds. My current task is to break down each utterance to identify strengths and areas for improvement, focusing on how to best address each element to ensure effective communication.
THINKING: **Structuring the Analysis**
I'm currently mapping out the JSON format for the output. I'm focusing on how to best represent the assessment findings for each of the six categories, ensuring a clear and structured presentation of my evaluation, in line with the provided example. I aim to balance conciseness with sufficient detail in my feedback to be useful.
THINKING: **Defining the Framework**
I'm focusing on how to structure the output in JSON format. I plan to use the six criteria to format my evaluation to provide a clear and organized analysis. This will include the positive points, the points that could be improved, and the specific suggestions as the user requested.
THINKING: **Forming Initial Assessment**
I'm now constructing a detailed, multi-faceted evaluation. I'm focusing on the first two turns, as I break the transcript down to identify strengths and weaknesses. I'm comparing the worker's actions to the six criteria, considering both the parent's and social worker's perspectives to ensure my analysis is complete.
THINKING: **Formulating Initial Critique**
I'm now meticulously contrasting the social worker's actions in the provided turns with the established six criteria. My goal is to identify strengths, pinpoint areas for improvement, and ensure each element of the exchange is thoroughly analyzed, with the goal of ensuring all relevant information from the transcript is fully addressed.
THINKING: **Synthesizing the Information**
I'm now weaving together the assessment of the initial interaction, integrating my analysis of the social worker's performance against the established criteria. The goal is to highlight strengths and address areas needing improvement based on the given transcript, while also comparing the self-assessment provided, and focusing on the disparities.
THINKING: **Forming Initial Assessment**
I'm now moving to the heart of the task, beginning my structured assessment. I'm comparing the worker's actions to the six categories, identifying areas of success and opportunity, and cross-referencing these findings with the social worker's self-evaluation to identify discrepancies. The goal is to analyze each element of the initial interaction.
THINKING: **Evaluating Transcript Elements**
I'm now thoroughly reviewing the transcript to evaluate the social worker's introduction against Arkansas Child Welfare standards. I am noting the strengths, such as specifying the reason for contact, and flagging weaknesses like the omission of agency affiliation and ID presentation. I want to give actionable recommendations.
THINKING: **Finalizing the Evaluation**
I'm now solidifying the assessment based on the transcript. I'm focusing on the areas for improvement like strengthening the introduction, and actively engaging with the parent after the self disclosure. The JSON structure is ready. I am considering the best language.
THINKING: **Forming the Evaluation**
I'm now fully structuring the final report, based on my analysis. I am using the transcript to formulate a complete evaluation, including the good points and areas of needed improvement, per the guidelines and using the JSON structure. I'm focusing on a clear, detailed summary.
THINKING: **Evaluating Feedback Structure**
I'm now finalizing the output format for the evaluation, using the six criteria and incorporating feedback on the social worker's performance. The JSON structure should be clear, detailed, and organized for ease of review. I will give actionable suggestions.
THINKING: **Synthesizing the Analysis**
I'm now structuring the report using the JSON format, incorporating the findings of my evaluation across the six key categories. I am focusing on clear, actionable recommendations, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses, as well as comparing the transcript to the social worker's self-assessment. My goal is to provide the user with a comprehensive and useful analysis.
THINKING: **Finalizing the Assessment**
I'm now summarizing the analysis of the initial exchange, comparing the worker's actions to the six criteria. I've highlighted strengths and identified areas for improvement, based on the transcript. My output will be structured in JSON format, providing concise feedback and actionable suggestions for the user.
THINKING: **Analyzing Dialogue Elements**
I've analyzed the transcript and incorporated the assessment of the social worker's interaction, comparing it to the six key criteria. I have provided actionable feedback, highlighting areas of strength and aspects needing further attention to give a complete analysis. The JSON output structure is ready, offering a clear and organized presentation.
THINKING: **Generating the Output**
I'm now preparing the final JSON response, reflecting my detailed analysis of the social worker's actions. I will be sure to incorporate the specific recommendations and highlight key strengths and areas for improvement. My aim is to present the feedback in a clear and well-structured format, addressing all required elements.

Recognize that the optimal place for children is safely in their own homes. 2. If children have to leave the home actively strive to preserve their connections to: Siblings; Family and familiar people; School and community of origin; Culture, religion, and tribal affiliations. \n...\n# VISION Every child has a safe and stable family every day. ## FROM THE DIRECTOR: Several years ago, the Arkansas Division of Children & Family Services (DCFS) began a journey to strengthen the child welfare system's approach to serving children and families by implementing safety organized practice (SOP). Safety organized practice engages families, their networks, and stakeholders as collaborative partners in making decisions about their children's safety. We worked with partners across the child welfare system and created an opportunity to build on that collaboration by clearly articulating the vision and values that serve as the heart of our work. We recognized that DCFS cannot support families alone and collaboration with a family's network and DCFS' community partners are necessary for sustainability. At One Table is Arkansas's practice model representing the culmination of our collective vision that every child deserves a safe, stable, and nurturing family every day. This overview of the practice model illustrates how we work every day to translate our vision and values into DCFS' practice with children and families by providing supervisors, managers, and field staff with concrete examples of the practices that best reflect our child welfare culture. \n...\n# VALUE 3 ## HELPING CHILDREN AND YOUTH ACHIEVE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL AND DEVELOP LIFELONG RELATIONSHIPS ### AGENCY PRACTICE Maintain a holistic view of the child/youth. Include and build on a family's strengths and resiliencies in order to maintain children/youth in their own home. Continuously assess safety throughout our involvement with children and families. Identify ways to lessen trauma to children/youth by using a trauma- informed perspective to promote healing. Maintain connections to important people, activities, and cultural traditions in the child/youth's life. Value placements with connections to the child/youth and family. Consider family culture when assessing permanency. 3. Identify living situations that support children and their relationships as soon as work with the family begins. 4. 5. Move toward child permanency every day. Continually focus on children's safety and well-being while they are in their own homes or in our care. Ensure the voice of the child/ youth is heard. Value the most permanent option for the child/youth, including reunification, adoption, and guardianship. Understand and value concurrent planning from day one. Establish legal permanency for children/youth, while having other support and lifelong connections in place. Value the need to have ongoing holistic needs assessments including developmental, behavioral, educational, dental, medical, psychological, etc. \n...\n# VALUE 1 ## RELATIONSHIPS WITH CHILDREN, YOUTH, AND FAMILIES ARE THE FOUNDATION ### KEY AREA LEADERSHIP ACTIONS: DO I... Review SDM system measures in SafeMeasures\u00ae? Use the safety/risk matrix? Use ecomaps, genograms, and Circles of Safety and Support in consultations? Identify practice leadership in the region that focuses on family- centered meetings? Use the SOP approach? ## KEY STATE LEADERSHIP ACTIONS: DO I... Stay informed on any legislative updates or changes that impact children, youth, and families? Keep the field and stakeholders informed and updated on legislative advocacy and updates? Create opportunities for families and community partners to share their experience, ideas, and recommendations for changes? Maintain transparency in how decisions are made in any implementation process? Ensure families have equitable avenues to share their complaints and pursue their grievances, be Identify family support systems using ecomaps, genograms, or Circles of Safety and Support? \u2611 Use the case plan tool with the family to create a behavior-based family case plan? \u2611 Use the SOP approach? Conduct individual and group supervision, as well as coaching? Encourage workers to lift up when families' needs fall outside of policy and procedures to find a solution? Conduct individual and group supervision, and coaching? \n...\n# VISION Every child has a safe and stable family every day. ## DCFS PRIORITIES The Arkansas Division of Children and Family Services (DCFS) has collaboratively designed a practice framework to guide the top three priorities of the agency. 1. Safely stabilize and preserve families; and if that is not possible ... 2. Safely care for children and quickly reunify children to their families of origin. If children must be removed from the home, relative and fictive kin caregivers will be considered immediately and throughout the entire engagement with the family; and if reunification is not possible . . . 3. Safely support child permanency, well-being, and development of culturally safe, lifelong relationships. Here is a description of the image: The image shows a pattern of overlapping circles in various shades of green, with one circle in blue. The circles are arranged in rows, with a darker green band across the bottom obscuring the lower halves of the circles in that row. The background is a lighter shade of green. The circles appear to have a brushstroke texture around their edges.

Reason for contact was stated in a way that was responsive to the parent and stated in a way that clearly identified the child safety concern without using inflammatory language. Reason for Contact: When we take the time to consider how we can clearly and empathetically articulate child safety concerns with the human being standing in front of us, before asking to enter their home, we are honoring them in multiple ways. First, we are sharing power through providing clear and specific reasons why child welfare has chosen to intervene in their lives. Second, when we avoid the use of inflammatory language we are not only respectful of the impact of such language, but also setting aside judgment allowing us to embrace a lens of curiosity Finally, by clearly articulating the reason for our contact before asking to enter into conversation, or their home, we are respecting their right to say, \u201cNo.\u201d This relates to the principles of Everyone Desires Respect, Judgements Can Wait and Partners Share Power. 3. Responded to parent's needs, current concerns and questions. For example, did responded to Tami asking for further clarification or repeating of \u201cwhy are you here?\" without defensiveness. \n...\n# Gathering Information 6. After entering Tami's home, started with stating the reason for contact using clear language that Tami understood. Start with Reason for Contact. When entering into a parent's home, it is respectful to communicate why you are there in a way that the parent can understand. Withholding or distracting from such information increases the power differential. Therefore, immediately sharing this information with the parent aligns with the principles Partners Share Power and Everyone Desires Respect. 7. Response to the parent when they express a need to talk about why a Child Welfare worker is there utilizes the Principles of Partnership and empowers the parent to lead the conversation. Parent Communication of Needs. When making initial contact, it is likely that the parent will want to address the reason you are there prior to discussing other topics. The principles, Partners Share Power and Judgments Can Wait are a reminder to pay attention to what verbal and nonverbal responses are communicating, to meet the parent where they are at, and to withhold preconceived notions based on a report. 8. Worker demonstrated curiosity and encouraged parent to share their story. Give Opportunity for Parent to Share. \n...\n# Gathering Information 1536. It is important for the parent to know what to anticipate and to know what their rights are in the process. Parents need to be able to know who and how to contact people involved in their assessment. Proving information in writing and confirming understanding ensures that the parent has access to information after you leave. This relates to the principles of Everyone Deserves to Be Heard and Everyone Deserves Respect. 18. Told the parent what the next steps are in the assessment process. Next Steps. An initial contact with a parent will not likely be your last. It is important for the caseworker to respond to a parent's questions and share what to expect throughout the process. This aligns with the principles Partnership is a Process and Sharing Power. \n...\nTaking Time to Respond: When we engage empathetically we are not only listening to the words, but the deeper meanings that are being shared in the moment. Those deeper meanings are often conveyed through various forms of body language. When we are receptive to the fully embodied message of the speaker in front of us we are honoring the principle that everyone needs to be heard and understood. Further, understanding not only involves the practice of listening, but the art of asking questions from a place of curiosity. When we practice listening and questioning in these ways, in all of our interactions, we are honoring the principle that Partnership is a Process. 4. Asked and received permission to enter the home without coercion Permission to Enter: By asking for permission and respecting their decision whether to enter their home, we are respecting their right to say, \u201cNo.\u201d This relates to the principles of Everyone Desires Respect and Partners Share Power. 5.

Formal networks may include personnel at the children's school, the justice system and social service providers. Some of these connections may be useful as safety service providers.10 Routine follow-up is important because these can be volatile situations that change rapidly, with changing safety needs. This can be especially true when Child Welfare intervenes because an abusive person can become more dangerous if control over the partner is threatened. It is a sad fact that most murdered victims are killed after they leave the relationship. To reiterate, safety will not necessarily be enhanced by creating expectations of the adult victim. We cannot legally limit contact between adults, and it may even increase danger. For example, an adult victim may know it will be safer if he or she seems compliant and maintains some contact with the abusive partner. When developing safety plans, use a fresh approach to each situation because each family is unique. Devising achievable and creative ways of holding the batterer accountable, on as many fronts as possible, will increase safety. It will be important to use your own creativity, critical thinking skills, social work experience and local contacts to craft viable strategies for each unique situation. \n...\nPayments to replace personal items that had to be left behind when fleeing abuse (clothes for victim and children, etc.), if such items are not available from other sources.CHILD WELFARE PRACTICES FOR CASES WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE92 # Back to TOC The program is opened for 90 days to allow time for the adult victim and children to stabilize their living situation and address immediate safety concerns. Participants may receive services more than once a year based upon current safety issues. Payments are generally made directly to landlords or to specific providers. When a client accesses Child Welfare and TANF services, DHS Child Welfare and Self- Sufficiency staff are encouraged to work together on service and case plans. This reduces the likelihood that the client is given conflicting expectations. ## Family Support and Connections program Family Support and Connections is available for TANF and Child Welfare clients. Staff provide families with advocacy for services in the community, supports to strengthen parenting, coping skills and other necessary skills to support the healthy development of their children. Services include: Home visits; Strengths/needs-based family assessments; Advocacy; Individualized family plans; Outcome-based case planning; and Emergency services. Services are designed to increase the parental protective factors of: Nurturing and attachment; Knowledge of parenting and child development; Parental resilience;CHILD WELFARE PRACTICES FOR CASES WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE93 \n...\n# Safety and domestic violence: strategies for increasing safety in Child Welfare cases involving a perpetrator of intimate partner violence Also, research indicates that people using coercive and controlling tactics against their intimate partners are more likely to act in safer ways when coordinated and consistent accountability strategies are implemented by a network of partners. Consistent reinforcement and repeated contacts are keys to success. Caseworkers are well placed to orchestrate a coordinated response. Child Welfare will be more successful creating a coordinated response to any specific incident of intimate partner violence if time has been invested in a proactive effort to engage community partners and problem-solve potential gaps and barriers in the system. Advance collaboration can enhance the lives of families and create a foundation for success. In each case, safety will be increased if the Child Welfare worker can create a network of engaged people that is as large and diverse as possible. Then, connect routinely with this network to: Confirm cooperation; Check on the abusive partner's location, stability and state of mind;CHILD WELFARE PRACTICES FOR CASES WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE44 # Back to TOC Ensure that uniform messages are being delivered; and, Make it clear to the abusive partner that everyone is working together to monitor them and their behavior. \n...\n# Developing written plans and mandating services Protective action plans, initial safety plans, ongoing safety plans, case plans and mandated services should be developmentally appropriate. It is vital that communication with teens be understandable and meaningful. It is important to have developmentally appropriate materials created for teens that explain the child welfare system and how to navigate it. It's also vital for teens to have the plans and expectations of the agency simply and carefully explained in a variety of ways \u2013 i.e., in written, visual and oral form. Using technology could be particularly effective (i.e., Internet, video, iPod downloads, etc.) It is important to note that housing is a particularly difficult problem for teens, especially when abusive parents or the batterer have been the source of financial support. It is very hard for teens to access any housing without cosigners. The issue of family of origin abuse can also be a barrier in accessing shelter services if parental consent is needed. In addition, a teen cannot get a restraining order without a guardian.CHILD WELFARE PRACTICES FOR CASES WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE # Back to TOC Some interventions that are especially useful for teens include expressive arts like journaling, drama, painting and poetry. According to the National Crime Prevention Council: Sometimes adults struggle to explain complex concepts in a way that teens will understand. \n...\n# Permanency ## Perform protective capacity assessment (PCA) The CPS assessment concludes with a determination of whether a child is safe or unsafe. When it is determined the child is unsafe, at the conclusion of the assessment, an ongoing safety plan is developed and the case is opened for services. The next phase is assessing the protective capacity of the parents or legal guardians. The PCA is intended to be a process of mutual discovery between the parent(s) and the caseworker. It should reveal the cognitive, behavioral and emotional characteristics that are present (the enhanced protective capacities/ strengths) and helpful in safely parenting, or not present (the diminished protective capacities/needs). The cognitive, behavioral and emotional characteristics should directly relate to the identified impending danger safety threats. When the caseworker understands which protective capacities must be increased to regain child safety, the caseworker can develop expected outcomes that are measurable and clearly focused on child safety. The focus is not on the services a parent must complete, but rather on the changes that need to happen for the parent(s) to safely parent in a sustainable way. The PCA looks at the impact of the batterer's pattern of coercive control, the parents' perspective on or awareness of the impending danger safety threats and the parents' motivation to make needed changes. \n...\n# Child Welfare Practices for Cases with Domestic Violence ## THE OREGON DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES ### CONTENTS\n Plan child safety meetings  53 \n Establish conditions for return home  54 \n Indian Child Welfare Act...... 54 \n Identify and notify legal parents of Department involvement  54 \n Arrange visitation...... 55 \n Mail or deliver notifications  56 \n Permanency  57 \n Perform protective capacity assessment (PCA)  57 \n Establish expected outcomes  63 \n Create action agreements  64 \n Plan and facilitate family meetings  67 \n Case closure..... 68 \n Confidentiality and information sharing  69 \n Section V.

Domestic violence may not have been initially identified as a present danger safety threat or impending danger safety threat in the assessment process when other abuse and neglect issues were present. Building rapport with the adult victim during the PCA can facilitate the sharing of information about domestic violence. This discovery can lead to a change in the ongoing safety plan and in the conditions for return. The following material relates to families for which domestic violence has specifically been identified as an impending danger safety threat; in other words, one or both parents' or caregivers' behavior is violent and/or they are acting (behaving) dangerously. Other impending danger safety threats and diminished protective capacities may also exist in families where domestic violence is present.CHILD WELFARE PRACTICES FOR CASES WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE58 # Back to TOC There are four stages in the initial PCA: preparation, introduction, exploration, and change strategy and case planning. The first stage is undertaken by the caseworker to thoughtfully prepare to engage the parents in the process. The second stage is intended to introduce the concepts of the PCA to the parents and to request their willingness to engage in the process. \n...\nThe suggestions below may help you start that process.11 10 It is often best practice to obtain releases of information (ROIs) from the abusive partner or the survivor even though these releases are not required during the CPS assessment process. Once the case moves from assessment to ongoing, DHS staff must obtain ROIs before discussing case specifics with anyone. \n...\n# Establish expected outcomes Use what you learn about the impending danger safety threats and diminished protective capacities to determine the expected outcomes. Clearly identify the behavioral, emotional and/or knowledge changes that are necessary in order for the children to be safe and for the Department to close the case. For the batterer, the expected outcome can be that the batterer takes responsibility for the violence and ceases to expose the children to controlling and violent behavior. Examples of behaviors that support accountability, responsibility and safety include: Ceasing to use tactics of coercive control, including violence if that is part of the pattern; Accepting responsibility for the choice to use tactics of coercive control and/or to be violent and saying that clearly to the adult victim and children; Accepting the responsibility for choosing to expose the children to domestic violence; Agreeing to and following through with safe levels of contact; Supporting the non-offending parent's parenting and relationship with the child; Demonstrating an understanding of the effect the domestic violence has on the children by supporting their participation in counseling; Demonstrating equal responsibility for the children's safety and well-being; Meeting the children's basic needs, such as financial and emotional support, without manipulating them or using them as bargaining tools. For the adult victim, determine expected outcomes that are realistic.

In order to keep a conversational flow to the interview, attempt to connect something the child mentioned in rapport building to one of the domains. For example, if the child mentioned watching movies, you might ask who in their family they typically watch movies with. Other questions to transition to the six domains might include: \u201cWho is a part of your family?\" followed by asking the child to describe various people. OR \u201cWhat does a normal day look like for you?\u201d Remember to avoid transitioning immediately to the report of concern or closely related topics as this can be anxiety provoking for the child and may prevent further narrative from developing. \n...\n# Child Interviewing Guide The following provides suggestions on how to begin an interview, questions to ask, and ways to close the interview.

Questions will need to be adapted based on the individual child's age and/or development ## Phase I: Introduction, Instructions and Rapport Building \u2610 ## \u2610 Verify you are speaking to the correct child ### Introduce yourself and identify the agency (avoid acronyms) Provide your first and last name, your pronouns, and the department which you represent. Do not use acronyms to avoid confusion. For example, \u201cHi, my name is I use pronouns. I work for the Oregon Department of Human Services, Child Welfare.\" Whether you are interviewing a child at school or at home, it's best practice to confirm you are speaking to the correct child by confirming their first and last name. This is also a good opportunity to ask the child if they prefer to go by a different name or have a nickname. It is good practice to also verify the child's pronouns after introducing your own.\u2610 Explain your role\u2610 \u2610 Remind the child that you work for Child Welfare.

Ask: Why is rapport building an important step in gathering information about safety? During the rapport building stage of the interview, the task is to demonstrate that you are there to listen as much as ask questions. The interview should begin by communicating that you can be respectful, have genuine curiosity for their lived experience, and are prepared to partner with them in a meaningful way. This is done through what you say in that first part but also what you do. Remember that only 7% of communication is conveyed through verbal means; the other 93% is conveyed through nonverbal means. Being aware of the messages you are sending 25 Portland State Child Welfare Partnership Essential Elements Curriculum and receiving from the moment you begin interacting with a family can go a long way. During the Engagement session on Day 2 of Essential Elements, you discussed ways to build rapport with a parent from the moment they open the door. One of those ways is through transparency in sharing information with the parent. Considering that many families may have previous experience with ODHS Child Welfare in which power and information was not shared, it is important to do this from the very beginning.

Introducing and explaining the process: We need to let children know who we are right away. We share our name and affiliation. An example might be; \"Hi, my name is I work for a place called child welfare. My job is to help children and families. I work with all kinds of kids and families and talk to them at home or at school. I ask a lot of questions and talk to lots of people.

Of course, we want them to talk with us so that we can ensure their safety, but we do not want them to feel that they are being held against their will. Checking in with the child: \u201cWhat were you just doing?\" It's important to know if we are interrupting something important in the child/teens day. \n...\nNote that the Cooper case is a domestic violence case and there are special considerations in making initial contact including: *Explore how to do the assessment when the alleged batterer is not home. If possible, call first to determine who is at home and how safe it is go to the home. *Consider meeting at a DHS Self-Sufficiency office, school or other neutral setting. *Immediately ask the alleged adult victim if it is safe to conduct an interview and, if not, ask what might be a safe way. *Never ask the alleged adult victim about domestic violence in front of the alleged batterer. Disclosures may make the alleged adult victim unsafe if the alleged batterer is in the vicinity. These suggestions are taken from the Child Welfare Practices for Cases with Domestic Violence.

We may see people who are angry, frustrated, fearful, crying, defensive or even indifferent. It's important to recognize emotions or reactions of the individuals we encounter. We do this through clarification and validation. Here is a description of the image: The image shows two women in what appears to be a casual conversation. One woman, who is the main focus, has dark curly hair pulled up in a bun and is wearing a light blue denim shirt. She is holding a mug in her hand and looking towards the other woman with a slight smile. The second woman is partially visible, with only the side of her face and hair (which is blonde and also in a bun) in view. The background suggests they are near a window with vertical blinds.

We value the voices, experiences, cultures, intellect and uniqueness of the children and families we serve. We believe that communities often already have the wisdom and assets to provide safe, stable and healthy lives for their children. Thus, Child Welfare needs to partner, listen and lift up community voices and their decision-making powers. This builds on existing resources, creates pathways to new resources and promotes community interdependence rather than a system of dependence. We value building authentic relationships and being accountable to communities of color and other marginalized communities by elevating their voices and proactively engaging with individuals, families and communities. This builds their power so Child Welfare and its partners can better ensure people's safety, health and well-being. We believe providing earlier, less-intrusive support for parents and families means more children can remain safe and healthy at home and in school. This helps children and young adults have better long-term outcomes and keep the bonds and connections critical to their well-being.

Recognize that the optimal place for children is safely in their own homes. 2. If children have to leave the home actively strive to preserve their connections to: Siblings; Family and familiar people; School and community of origin; Culture, religion, and tribal affiliations. \n...\n# VISION Every child has a safe and stable family every day. ## FROM THE DIRECTOR: Several years ago, the Arkansas Division of Children & Family Services (DCFS) began a journey to strengthen the child welfare system's approach to serving children and families by implementing safety organized practice (SOP). Safety organized practice engages families, their networks, and stakeholders as collaborative partners in making decisions about their children's safety. We worked with partners across the child welfare system and created an opportunity to build on that collaboration by clearly articulating the vision and values that serve as the heart of our work. We recognized that DCFS cannot support families alone and collaboration with a family's network and DCFS' community partners are necessary for sustainability. At One Table is Arkansas's practice model representing the culmination of our collective vision that every child deserves a safe, stable, and nurturing family every day. This overview of the practice model illustrates how we work every day to translate our vision and values into DCFS' practice with children and families by providing supervisors, managers, and field staff with concrete examples of the practices that best reflect our child welfare culture. \n...\n# VALUE 3 ## HELPING CHILDREN AND YOUTH ACHIEVE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL AND DEVELOP LIFELONG RELATIONSHIPS ### AGENCY PRACTICE Maintain a holistic view of the child/youth.

Safely stabilize and preserve families; and if that is not possible ... 2. Safely care for children and quickly reunify children to their families of origin. If children must be removed from the home, relative and fictive kin caregivers will be considered immediately and throughout the entire engagement with the family; and if reunification is not possible . . . 3. Safely support child permanency, well-being, and development of culturally safe, lifelong relationships.

Reason for contact was stated in a way that was responsive to the parent and stated in a way that clearly identified the child safety concern without using inflammatory language. Reason for Contact: When we take the time to consider how we can clearly and empathetically articulate child safety concerns with the human being standing in front of us, before asking to enter their home, we are honoring them in multiple ways. First, we are sharing power through providing clear and specific reasons why child welfare has chosen to intervene in their lives. Second, when we avoid the use of inflammatory language we are not only respectful of the impact of such language, but also setting aside judgment allowing us to embrace a lens of curiosity Finally, by clearly articulating the reason for our contact before asking to enter into conversation, or their home, we are respecting their right to say, \u201cNo.\u201d This relates to the principles of Everyone Desires Respect, Judgements Can Wait and Partners Share Power. 3. Responded to parent's needs, current concerns and questions. For example, did responded to Tami asking for further clarification or repeating of \u201cwhy are you here?\" without defensiveness. \n...\n# Gathering Information 6. After entering Tami's home, started with stating the reason for contact using clear language that Tami understood. Start with Reason for Contact. When entering into a parent's home, it is respectful to communicate why you are there in a way that the parent can understand. Withholding or distracting from such information increases the power differential. Therefore, immediately sharing this information with the parent aligns with the principles Partners Share Power and Everyone Desires Respect. 7. Response to the parent when they express a need to talk about why a Child Welfare worker is there utilizes the Principles of Partnership and empowers the parent to lead the conversation. Parent Communication of Needs. When making initial contact, it is likely that the parent will want to address the reason you are there prior to discussing other topics. The principles, Partners Share Power and Judgments Can Wait are a reminder to pay attention to what verbal and nonverbal responses are communicating, to meet the parent where they are at, and to withhold preconceived notions based on a report. 8. Worker demonstrated curiosity and encouraged parent to share their story. Give Opportunity for Parent to Share. \n...\n# Gathering Information 1536. It is important for the parent to know what to anticipate and to know what their rights are in the process. Parents need to be able to know who and how to contact people involved in their assessment. Proving information in writing and confirming understanding ensures that the parent has access to information after you leave. This relates to the principles of Everyone Deserves to Be Heard and Everyone Deserves Respect. 18. Told the parent what the next steps are in the assessment process. Next Steps. An initial contact with a parent will not likely be your last. It is important for the caseworker to respond to a parent's questions and share what to expect throughout the process. This aligns with the principles Partnership is a Process and Sharing Power. \n...\nTaking Time to Respond: When we engage empathetically we are not only listening to the words, but the deeper meanings that are being shared in the moment. Those deeper meanings are often conveyed through various forms of body language. When we are receptive to the fully embodied message of the speaker in front of us we are honoring the principle that everyone needs to be heard and understood. Further, understanding not only involves the practice of listening, but the art of asking questions from a place of curiosity. When we practice listening and questioning in these ways, in all of our interactions, we are honoring the principle that Partnership is a Process. 4. Asked and received permission to enter the home without coercion Permission to Enter: By asking for permission and respecting their decision whether to enter their home, we are respecting their right to say, \u201cNo.\u201d This relates to the principles of Everyone Desires Respect and Partners Share Power. 5.

Formal networks may include personnel at the children's school, the justice system and social service providers. Some of these connections may be useful as safety service providers.10 Routine follow-up is important because these can be volatile situations that change rapidly, with changing safety needs. This can be especially true when Child Welfare intervenes because an abusive person can become more dangerous if control over the partner is threatened. It is a sad fact that most murdered victims are killed after they leave the relationship. To reiterate, safety will not necessarily be enhanced by creating expectations of the adult victim. We cannot legally limit contact between adults, and it may even increase danger. For example, an adult victim may know it will be safer if he or she seems compliant and maintains some contact with the abusive partner. When developing safety plans, use a fresh approach to each situation because each family is unique. Devising achievable and creative ways of holding the batterer accountable, on as many fronts as possible, will increase safety. It will be important to use your own creativity, critical thinking skills, social work experience and local contacts to craft viable strategies for each unique situation. \n...\nPayments to replace personal items that had to be left behind when fleeing abuse (clothes for victim and children, etc.), if such items are not available from other sources.CHILD WELFARE PRACTICES FOR CASES WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE92 # Back to TOC The program is opened for 90 days to allow time for the adult victim and children to stabilize their living situation and address immediate safety concerns. Participants may receive services more than once a year based upon current safety issues. Payments are generally made directly to landlords or to specific providers. When a client accesses Child Welfare and TANF services, DHS Child Welfare and Self- Sufficiency staff are encouraged to work together on service and case plans. This reduces the likelihood that the client is given conflicting expectations. ## Family Support and Connections program Family Support and Connections is available for TANF and Child Welfare clients. Staff provide families with advocacy for services in the community, supports to strengthen parenting, coping skills and other necessary skills to support the healthy development of their children. Services include: Home visits; Strengths/needs-based family assessments; Advocacy; Individualized family plans; Outcome-based case planning; and Emergency services.

Consistent reinforcement and repeated contacts are keys to success. Caseworkers are well placed to orchestrate a coordinated response. Child Welfare will be more successful creating a coordinated response to any specific incident of intimate partner violence if time has been invested in a proactive effort to engage community partners and problem-solve potential gaps and barriers in the system. Advance collaboration can enhance the lives of families and create a foundation for success. In each case, safety will be increased if the Child Welfare worker can create a network of engaged people that is as large and diverse as possible. Then, connect routinely with this network to: Confirm cooperation; Check on the abusive partner's location, stability and state of mind;CHILD WELFARE PRACTICES FOR CASES WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE44 # Back to TOC Ensure that uniform messages are being delivered; and, Make it clear to the abusive partner that everyone is working together to monitor them and their behavior. \n...\n# Developing written plans and mandating services Protective action plans, initial safety plans, ongoing safety plans, case plans and mandated services should be developmentally appropriate. It is vital that communication with teens be understandable and meaningful. It is important to have developmentally appropriate materials created for teens that explain the child welfare system and how to navigate it. It's also vital for teens to have the plans and expectations of the agency simply and carefully explained in a variety of ways \u2013 i.e., in written, visual and oral form. Using technology could be particularly effective (i.e., Internet, video, iPod downloads, etc.) It is important to note that housing is a particularly difficult problem for teens, especially when abusive parents or the batterer have been the source of financial support. It is very hard for teens to access any housing without cosigners. The issue of family of origin abuse can also be a barrier in accessing shelter services if parental consent is needed. In addition, a teen cannot get a restraining order without a guardian.CHILD WELFARE PRACTICES FOR CASES WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE # Back to TOC Some interventions that are especially useful for teens include expressive arts like journaling, drama, painting and poetry. According to the National Crime Prevention Council: Sometimes adults struggle to explain complex concepts in a way that teens will understand. \n...\n# Permanency ## Perform protective capacity assessment (PCA) The CPS assessment concludes with a determination of whether a child is safe or unsafe. When it is determined the child is unsafe, at the conclusion of the assessment, an ongoing safety plan is developed and the case is opened for services. The next phase is assessing the protective capacity of the parents or legal guardians. The PCA is intended to be a process of mutual discovery between the parent(s) and the caseworker. It should reveal the cognitive, behavioral and emotional characteristics that are present (the enhanced protective capacities/ strengths) and helpful in safely parenting, or not present (the diminished protective capacities/needs). The cognitive, behavioral and emotional characteristics should directly relate to the identified impending danger safety threats. When the caseworker understands which protective capacities must be increased to regain child safety, the caseworker can develop expected outcomes that are measurable and clearly focused on child safety. The focus is not on the services a parent must complete, but rather on the changes that need to happen for the parent(s) to safely parent in a sustainable way. The PCA looks at the impact of the batterer's pattern of coercive control, the parents' perspective on or awareness of the impending danger safety threats and the parents' motivation to make needed changes. \n...\n# Child Welfare Practices for Cases with Domestic Violence ## THE OREGON DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES ### CONTENTS\n Plan child safety meetings  53 \n Establish conditions for return home  54 \n Indian Child Welfare Act...... 54 \n Identify and notify legal parents of Department involvement  54 \n Arrange visitation...... 55 \n Mail or deliver notifications  56 \n Permanency  57 \n Perform protective capacity assessment (PCA)  57 \n Establish expected outcomes  63 \n Create action agreements  64 \n Plan and facilitate family meetings  67 \n Case closure..... 68 \n Confidentiality and information sharing  69 \n Section V.

Domestic violence may not have been initially identified as a present danger safety threat or impending danger safety threat in the assessment process when other abuse and neglect issues were present. Building rapport with the adult victim during the PCA can facilitate the sharing of information about domestic violence. This discovery can lead to a change in the ongoing safety plan and in the conditions for return. The following material relates to families for which domestic violence has specifically been identified as an impending danger safety threat; in other words, one or both parents' or caregivers' behavior is violent and/or they are acting (behaving) dangerously. Other impending danger safety threats and diminished protective capacities may also exist in families where domestic violence is present.CHILD WELFARE PRACTICES FOR CASES WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE58 # Back to TOC There are four stages in the initial PCA: preparation, introduction, exploration, and change strategy and case planning. The first stage is undertaken by the caseworker to thoughtfully prepare to engage the parents in the process. The second stage is intended to introduce the concepts of the PCA to the parents and to request their willingness to engage in the process. \n...\nThe suggestions below may help you start that process.11 10 It is often best practice to obtain releases of information (ROIs) from the abusive partner or the survivor even though these releases are not required during the CPS assessment process. Once the case moves from assessment to ongoing, DHS staff must obtain ROIs before discussing case specifics with anyone. \n...\n# Establish expected outcomes Use what you learn about the impending danger safety threats and diminished protective capacities to determine the expected outcomes. Clearly identify the behavioral, emotional and/or knowledge changes that are necessary in order for the children to be safe and for the Department to close the case. For the batterer, the expected outcome can be that the batterer takes responsibility for the violence and ceases to expose the children to controlling and violent behavior. Examples of behaviors that support accountability, responsibility and safety include: Ceasing to use tactics of coercive control, including violence if that is part of the pattern; Accepting responsibility for the choice to use tactics of coercive control and/or to be violent and saying that clearly to the adult victim and children; Accepting the responsibility for choosing to expose the children to domestic violence; Agreeing to and following through with safe levels of contact; Supporting the non-offending parent's parenting and relationship with the child; Demonstrating an understanding of the effect the domestic violence has on the children by supporting their participation in counseling; Demonstrating equal responsibility for the children's safety and well-being; Meeting the children's basic needs, such as financial and emotional support, without manipulating them or using them as bargaining tools. For the adult victim, determine expected outcomes that are realistic.

In order to keep a conversational flow to the interview, attempt to connect something the child mentioned in rapport building to one of the domains. For example, if the child mentioned watching movies, you might ask who in their family they typically watch movies with. Other questions to transition to the six domains might include: \u201cWho is a part of your family?\" followed by asking the child to describe various people. OR \u201cWhat does a normal day look like for you?\u201d Remember to avoid transitioning immediately to the report of concern or closely related topics as this can be anxiety provoking for the child and may prevent further narrative from developing. \n...\n# Child Interviewing Guide The following provides suggestions on how to begin an interview, questions to ask, and ways to close the interview.

Questions will need to be adapted based on the individual child's age and/or development ## Phase I: Introduction, Instructions and Rapport Building \u2610 ## \u2610 Verify you are speaking to the correct child ### Introduce yourself and identify the agency (avoid acronyms) Provide your first and last name, your pronouns, and the department which you represent. Do not use acronyms to avoid confusion. For example, \u201cHi, my name is I use pronouns. I work for the Oregon Department of Human Services, Child Welfare.\" Whether you are interviewing a child at school or at home, it's best practice to confirm you are speaking to the correct child by confirming their first and last name. This is also a good opportunity to ask the child if they prefer to go by a different name or have a nickname. It is good practice to also verify the child's pronouns after introducing your own.\u2610 Explain your role\u2610 \u2610 Remind the child that you work for Child Welfare.

This session will reinforce the critical role of engaging families in achieving safe outcomes for children and how cultural factors, worker bias and authority can impact gathering information. Participants will practice strengths-based interviewing and rapport building strategies. They will also learn how their own actions and words can impact a parent or child's ability and willingness to share information. Through case scenarios and role playing, participants will develop skills in trauma informed interviewing practice Time: 6 Hours, 30 minutes Recommended Class Size: Approx. 30 ## Learning Objectives: Identify the information that needs to be gathered related to each of the six domains and the sources from which it can be gathered Know how to use strengths based, trauma-informed, and culturally responsive interviewing strategies with children and families involved in the CPS assessment process Know strategies to engage with a child in a legally sound interview process based on development, age and cognitive ability ## Materials: 1 Simulation Instructions and Information (SW 02.15.2024) 2 Self Paced Learning (SW 05.16.2023) 3 Working Respectfully with Families (SW 11.02.2023) \n...\n4 Culture and False Positives (SW 11.02.2023) 5 Narrative Practice (SW 11.02.2023) 6 Developmentally Appropriate Interviews (SW 11.02.2023) 7 Interviewing Children with Disabilities (SW 11.02.2023) 8 PPT Gathering Info (SW 02.15.2024) 1 Portland State Child Welfare Partnership Essential Elements Curriculum 9 Child Interviewing Guide (SW 05.16.2023) 10 Six Domains Tool (SW 11.02.2023) 11 Solution Focused Questions (SW 11.02.2023) HO-Child Int.

Ask: Why is rapport building an important step in gathering information about safety? During the rapport building stage of the interview, the task is to demonstrate that you are there to listen as much as ask questions. The interview should begin by communicating that you can be respectful, have genuine curiosity for their lived experience, and are prepared to partner with them in a meaningful way. This is done through what you say in that first part but also what you do. Remember that only 7% of communication is conveyed through verbal means; the other 93% is conveyed through nonverbal means. Being aware of the messages you are sending 25 Portland State Child Welfare Partnership Essential Elements Curriculum and receiving from the moment you begin interacting with a family can go a long way. During the Engagement session on Day 2 of Essential Elements, you discussed ways to build rapport with a parent from the moment they open the door. One of those ways is through transparency in sharing information with the parent. Considering that many families may have previous experience with ODHS Child Welfare in which power and information was not shared, it is important to do this from the very beginning.

Time spent in this area can create a valuable return on investment later on in the interview when gathering abuse specific information. Introducing and explaining the process: We need to let children know who we are right away. We share our name and affiliation. An example might be; \"Hi, my name is I work for a place called child welfare. My job is to help children and families. I work with all kinds of kids and families and talk to them at home or at school. I ask a lot of questions and talk to lots of people. But before I start, do you have any questions for me?\" Asking Permission: Children should know that they have a choice to talk with us or not talk with us. Of course, we want them to talk with us so that we can ensure their safety, but we do not want them to feel that they are being held against their will. Checking in with the child: \u201cWhat were you just doing?\" It's important to know if we are interrupting something important in the child/teens day. \n...\nNote that the Cooper case is a domestic violence case and there are special considerations in making initial contact including: *Explore how to do the assessment when the alleged batterer is not home. If possible, call first to determine who is at home and how safe it is go to the home. *Consider meeting at a DHS Self-Sufficiency office, school or other neutral setting. *Immediately ask the alleged adult victim if it is safe to conduct an interview and, if not, ask what might be a safe way. *Never ask the alleged adult victim about domestic violence in front of the alleged batterer. Disclosures may make the alleged adult victim unsafe if the alleged batterer is in the vicinity. These suggestions are taken from the Child Welfare Practices for Cases with Domestic Violence. Case practice in cases involving domestic violence will be discussed more in Week 2 of training. How would you share information about the report of concern with Sara Cooper, after confirming that the alleged perpetrator of domestic violence is not present? \n...\n# Self-Paced Learning ## #4: Introduction and Building Rapport with Children 1. Practice individually how you would say your introduction, describing your role, and going through the instructions of the interview 2. What questions do you have about the introduction, describing your role, and going over instructions? Read the article about Narrative Practice using the link below OR by locating the article in your binder. As you read, write down a question you have or make note of something that stands out to you. Narrative Practice (What is it and Why is it Important?): 1. What questions or comments do you have about narrative practice? 2. How would you start narrative practice with Daniel Rich? (The screening report can be found for review using this link or in the screening tab of your binder) # #5: Developmentally Appropriate Interviews Different workers will have different interviewing styles. No matter your style, you always need to ensure you are moving through the above steps with every child (even teens!) With that, you will also need to make adjustments based on the age and development of the child. This idea will be explored further in the third week and in Wellbeing training, but each time you interact with a child, you have to consider how to intervene in a developmentally appropriate way.

The trainer should ensure the following are addressed: o Consider the tone and language you use when you call someone or the way you knock on someone's door. o Validating emotions \u2013 Consider the wide range of emotions a parent/caregiver may be experiencing when child welfare makes contact. We may see people who are angry, frustrated, fearful, crying, defensive or even indifferent. It's important to recognize emotions or reactions of the individuals we encounter. We do this through clarification and validation. Here is a description of the image: The image shows two women in what appears to be a casual conversation.

We believe that communities often already have the wisdom and assets to provide safe, stable and healthy lives for their children. Thus, Child Welfare needs to partner, listen and lift up community voices and their decision-making powers. This builds on existing resources, creates pathways to new resources and promotes community interdependence rather than a system of dependence. We value building authentic relationships and being accountable to communities of color and other marginalized communities by elevating their voices and proactively engaging with individuals, families and communities. This builds their power so Child Welfare and its partners can better ensure people's safety, health and well-being.

Possible examples include: o The parent can keep calm when the children misbehave. They can sit with the child to help them regain composure and move through difficult situations. o The parent has been employed for two years and is able to cover the family's living expenses because of this steady employment. o The parent understands young children should not be exposed to substances and takes great care to ensure any substance use occurs outside of the home. o The grandparents live within walking distance of the family home and have daily contact with the children.

THINKING: **Evaluating Interview Strategies**
I'm currently focusing on Arkansas child welfare training materials to guide my analysis. My primary objective is to offer pointed, helpful feedback on the parent interview transcript, emphasizing best practices. I'm carefully assessing interview techniques and looking for areas where improvements could be made.
THINKING: **Refining Analysis Framework**
I've broken down the analysis into discrete, manageable steps, focusing on aligning the transcript evaluation with the prescribed criteria. I'm now focusing on the detailed assessment phase, ensuring alignment with Arkansas child welfare training materials, and scoring each criterion. The key is to ensure feedback is directly tied to specific transcript instances.
THINKING: **Defining Evaluation Criteria**
I'm now meticulously dissecting the Arkansas child welfare training materials. I'm creating a detailed rubric to systematically assess the interview transcript. This involves a clear understanding of what constitutes "met," "partially met," and "not met" for each criterion. My current task is to pinpoint specific training elements relevant to each phase of the interview.
THINKING: **Developing Feedback Structure**
I'm now focused on translating the self-assessment and transcript excerpts into concrete, actionable feedback. I'm meticulously planning the structure for each criterion, ensuring it contains evidence, an assessment score, and targeted suggestions for improvement. This involves referencing specific training materials and best practices, along with citations.
THINKING: **Developing Interview Feedback**
I'm now synthesizing the transcript analysis with the self-assessment to create targeted feedback, focusing on Arkansas child welfare best practices. I am carefully formulating each criterion, and composing the feedback, which includes the specific evidence, scores, and actionable suggestions. The main goal is to offer practical steps for enhancing interview techniques, by referencing both the parent's responses and training materials.
THINKING: **Formulating the JSON Output**
I'm now finalizing the JSON structure, ensuring that each criterion has a score, evidence, and actionable feedback linked to Arkansas training materials. I'm focusing on clarity and conciseness. My goal is to create a comprehensive, yet easy-to-understand report that can enhance the social worker's interview skills. The final step is to assemble this information, including strengths and areas for improvement, into the structured output.
THINKING: **Finalizing Feedback and Output**
I'm now thoroughly reviewing the feedback for each criterion, ensuring alignment with best practices and Arkansas training materials, before finalizing the JSON output. The goal is to provide a clear, comprehensive report, highlighting strengths and weaknesses. I'm also including supporting citations to specific points within the transcript.
THINKING: **Constructing the Analysis Framework**
I'm currently in the phase of thoroughly constructing the detailed analysis framework to guide the evaluation process. I am preparing to match each element of the interview transcript with the prescribed criteria, while ensuring a systematic approach. I am ensuring that the feedback will directly connect to specific instances from the transcript.
THINKING: **Structuring the Feedback**
I'm currently preparing the JSON output to ensure it accurately reflects the analysis. Each criterion will include a score, evidence from the transcript, and actionable feedback linked to best practices. My focus is to deliver the report in a clear, concise format. The primary goal is to offer a report that is both comprehensive and easily understood.
THINKING: **Developing the Analysis Report**
I'm now focusing on the overall organization. I am translating the detailed findings, including the evidence, scores, and specific feedback for each criterion, into a comprehensive report. The plan is to ensure clarity and conciseness in the final output, by referencing the parent's responses.

  "overallSummary": "Your self-reflection demonstrates excellent professional insight and a commitment to continuous improvement. While this interaction presented significant challenges, your ability to recognize the impact of your approach is a valuable asset in social work practice. The following feedback aims to build on your strengths while providing concrete strategies based on Arkansas child welfare best practices for initial home visits.",
  "strengths": [
    "Demonstrated strong self-awareness by recognizing the confrontational approach and its immediate negative impact on the parent's defensiveness.",
    "Showed persistence in attempting to address reported child safety concerns, indicating a commitment to the children's well-being."

      "suggestion": "Begin every interaction with a complete, clear introduction including your full name, specific agency (e.g., Arkansas Department of Human Services, Division of Children and Family Services), your role (e.g., Child Protective Services Investigator), and proactively present your official identification badge. This establishes credibility and helps to alleviate initial suspicion, which is a cornerstone of effective engagement in child welfare."

      "area": "De-escalation and Empathetic Communication",
      "suggestion": "When a parent expresses confusion, anger, or defensiveness, acknowledge their emotions first. Phrases like 'I understand this is unexpected and likely upsetting for you' or 'It's natural to have questions when someone shows up unannounced' can validate their feelings. Avoid immediately escalating with accusations or threats. Focus on active listening and responding to their immediate concerns (e.g., 'Yes, I have my ID right here, and I can explain why I'm here')."

    {
      "area": "Clear and Non-Accusatory Reason for Contact",

Instead of stating 'we know there's been violence and drug use,' frame it as 'We've received a report expressing concerns for your children's safety, and my role is to gather information to understand the situation and ensure their well-being.' This approach is less confrontational and more conducive to cooperation."

    {
      "area": "Respectful Request for Permission and Explanation of Rights",
      "suggestion": "Always respectfully request permission to enter the home, explaining the purpose of the visit and what you hope to accomplish inside. Clearly explain the parent's rights, including their right to refuse entry without a court order, and the potential consequences of refusal. This transparency builds trust and adheres to legal and ethical best practices."

Best practices in Arkansas child welfare require a full introduction including your name, specific agency (e.g., DCFS), role, and the proactive presentation of official identification.

      "feedback": "While you stated there was a 'call about your kids,' the subsequent explanation was accusatory and confrontational. Best practice dictates explaining the *nature* of the concern (e.g., 'concerns for safety') in a non-judgmental way, focusing on the agency's responsibility to assess, rather than stating allegations as facts.

When the parent asserted their right to refuse ('I don't have to let you in! Where's your warrant?' [T4]), the worker immediately resorted to a threat of police involvement. Arkansas training emphasizes explaining the purpose of entry and the parent's rights regarding entry, seeking voluntary cooperation before considering other legal avenues."

      "feedback": "Information gathering was primarily through accusatory statements rather than open-ended, non-judgmental questions designed to understand the situation from the parent's perspective. The only direct question about a person ('Where's Shawn?') came within a threatening context, making it unlikely to yield accurate or cooperative information. Effective information gathering relies on building rapport and trust, which was not established here."

Providing this information is crucial for transparency, empowering parents, and managing expectations, even when cooperation is challenging. This is a key component of initial contact protocols in child welfare."
